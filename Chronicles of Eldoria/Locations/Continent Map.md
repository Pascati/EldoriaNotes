>[!info] Unfortunately, the plugin I use to generate an interactive world map doesn't work/isn't available on Quartz âœŠðŸ˜” I'll probably look into making it work one day, but even the original Obsidian plugin is experimental, so don't get your hopes up.

```leaflet
id: eldoria-continent-map
image: [[Continent Map.jpg]]
bounds:
    - [0, 0]
    - [983.04, 983.04]
unit: miles
lat: 491.52
long: 491.52
minZoom: -1
maxZoom: 3
defaultZoom: 0
