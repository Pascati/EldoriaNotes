# WE BEGIN: TAVERN

## Meeting [[Nicholas Powers]]
- Insight:
	- Cordelia: 5

	- Kaya: NAT 20
		- Kaya can IMMEDIATELY tell that this guy is lying through his teeth -- the only truth is that he has two guns
	- Camille: 11
		- Camille isn't sure if he's lying or telling the truth (skeptical)
- Camille catches up to the dude, gives him their beer
	- The story they get is one about Nicholas going against a band of bandits -- this time it's not entirely a lie (Camille can tell) but is embellishing the truth
- Kaya needles the guy about the mission
- Cordelia asks about his guns

## THE GANG GETS TOGETHER
- We all agree that this guy is kinda incompetent and definitely lying
- Cordelia drops that most people in [[Clover Military|the military]] don't have guns ðŸ‘€ so it's interesting that he has *two*
- Bartender brings us 3 flagons of nice alcohol (left behind by Nicholas)
	- He points us towards [[Burt Maclyn]] (tall, Orchish man, balding, always carries a broach with him)
- We agree to adventure together!!

# Post-Combat
