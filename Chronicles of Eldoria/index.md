This is the home page. To see the notes, see the menu on the left (or tap on the three bars in the top-left corner, if you're on mobile)!

It's also worth noting that this website has ***dark mode enabled!*** Just click/tap the little sun/moon icon in the left menu (desktop) or at the top of your screen (mobile).

This is a constant work in progress, but if something breaks or goes wrong, please don't hesitate to let me know! You know where to find me ðŸ˜Ž

TEST CHANGE
>[!INFO] NOTE: Through Sessions 1-8, ALL instances of a character/location's name are backlinked (e.g. every time Vallen's name would come up, it would link to his character page). However, that gets cluttered FAST and also Izzie gets tired, so in the notes for Sessions 9-onward, only the **first instance** of a character/object/location's name is backlinked. If you want to go to the page of a character/object/location that was mentioned in a session, there will be a "Backlinks" section at the bottom of the page (or on the right, if you're on desktop) that will contain links to every relevant person/object/location from that session.
