	- We keep walking, despite [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen‚Äôs]] voice asking us to stop and asking what we‚Äôre doing

# Escaping the [[Forest of Mysteries]]
- The path lightens up a little, and we hear [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen‚Äôs]] voice again asking us what the fuck we‚Äôre doing

	- It looks like a sun with pointy rays
	- He found it in an ancient city in Diamond 200 years ago
	- The city looked like it had cathedrals (very very old cathedrals)
	- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] says Diamond is a very interesting kingdom
		- *‚ÄúIts people are very complacent, I‚Äôd say‚Äù*
		- Compared to Clover, whose culture and organization revolves around status (military), Diamond residents are more loyal to their immediate cities rather than their kingdom
		- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] comments that people seemed happier in Diamond, but it was almost like a fake happiness
			- He comments on how the people of Clover seem to ‚Äúknow better‚Äù, but stops himself
			- The party asks him to speak his mind, and he asks what would happen if the [[Clover military]] was disbanded (Cordelia‚Äôs livelihood would fall apart)
		- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] says there‚Äôs pros and cons to both kingdoms -- [[Clover Military|Clover‚Äôs military]] is powerful, while Diamond wants Clover to follow their way of life (but [[Clover Military|Clover‚Äôs military]] can usually overpower Diamond‚Äôs)

# Arriving at [[Crossroads]]
- After 3-4 hours of walking **(it is now 6-7 PM)**, we see a lake in the distance and a small village ([[Crossroads]]) along the lake. The road splits in three directions: one leading to [[Crossroads]], the other going straight, and the third leading to a bridge going to [[Steel Pine]]
- [[Crossroads]] is a bustling town!
	- We see a bar with a barn that looks similar to [[Foo Bar]] (but isn‚Äôt quite it)

		- The gang immediately tries to distract him with more drinks
		- There‚Äôs a man from Diamond looking for him specifically
	- Cal tries to sneak away (Stealth 17), and **Cordelia lies to Nick and says that Cal‚Äôs name is actually ‚ÄúJack‚Äù**
		- CORDELIA FARTS WHILE LYING BUT IT‚ÄôS OK BCS SHE ROLLED HIGH
	- The man from Diamond **needs to find Cal and [[Caduceus Pope|‚Äúthe scientist‚Äù]] for tests**
	- **[[Nicholas Powers|Nick‚Äôs]] plan was to go to [[Holden]] and sneak into [[Dagen's Masquerade|the party we‚Äôre going to]]**
		- He was just gonna hide in the corner
		- BUT he‚Äôs planning on skipping out on that and going to a nearby party in Diamond instead

	- BACK TO CORDELIA AND CAMILLE
		- Camille tells Cordelia that they‚Äôre still upset, but she‚Äôs still their friend -- they just need some time to cool off
		- CORDELIA IS SO SADDD. IZZIE IS ALSO SAD :(((
			- neither of them have had a friend like this before‚Ä¶. the homies r hurt
- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] follows Cal outside (Cal is walking in the opposite direction of the inn)
	- **Cal tells [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] EVERYTHING.** The players at the table don‚Äôt know anything though
	- Cal has [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen‚Äôs]] trust on this, he‚Äôs not going to share what they spoke about

## The [[Dreams & Visions|Dreams]] Return
- As we all fall asleep, we are met with yet another dream, although this one feels a little more peaceful than the previous ones
	- The ground is made of a serene plane of water, with clouds reflected in the sky above (like Tanjiro Demon Slayer‚Äôs soul)
- In the space in front of us, a tear opens. Through it, a castle under a sky filled with pouring rain appears. Even if our character hasn‚Äôt been to [[Holden]], we can *tell* it‚Äôs in [[Holden]]
	- People file into the castle, and then the scene changes: inside the castle, people dance and sing, there‚Äôs music and partying abound
	- The vision greys out and changes again. It‚Äôs a massive tomb filled with wires and machinery (much like Foo‚Äôs secret room, but on a MUCH larger scale). **There is a drawing of an upright triangle painted on a piece of parchment atop an easel**
- We don‚Äôt see each other in this dream, but we have the same one all the same

## We Awake

	- He also says that it‚Äôll give them a chance to talk? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?? IZZIE GETS SCARED üòß
