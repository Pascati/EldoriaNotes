# Mystery Gang Go!
- Group Investigation
	- Cordelia: 24
	- Kaya: 6
	- Cal: 19
	- Camille: 13
- Everyone (except for Kaya) notice blood tracks from the body towards the window
	- The window appears to have been *broken outwards* -- there is glass outside, but not inside
	- This means the vampire went outside
- How long has the woman been dead?
	- 3-4 hours (based on our collective investigation checks)
- Is it shady enough for a vampire to go outside?
	- No?
- Cal asks how the vampire got *inside*, since (most) vampires need to be invited inside of buildings
	- The man admits that **his marriage was failing, so his wife invited someone else inside last night**
- QUICK ASIDE: CORDELIA NOW HAS AN EXTRA SKILL SO SHE CAN ROLL TO "STICK HER DICK IN IT" ![[Pasted image 20250629201534.png]]
- The husband admits to **double cheating** on his wife, which is why he wasn't home
- Camille offers to help bury the wife's body -- the husband is amenable to that
- There's a knock at the door. It is a WOMAN!!
	- ![[Investigator Teasley.png|240]]
	- **Investigator Teasley**
	- WE'RE NOW MURDER SUSPECTS
- Cordelia takes the accusation PERSONALLY!! So does Kaya -- Camille's like "idc this makes sense"
- Investigator Teasley already knows about us! She's just doing her due diligence
- Camille asks Cal to inform Investigator Teasley about the vampire
	- The way he talks immediately stresses Camille out. fuck this stupid baka life
- Investigator Teasley says that she'll swap information with us *at the garrison* before she leaves
- Cordelia gets on Vallen's ASS for not speaking up while the Investigator was here
	- HE'S LITERALLY A VAMPIRE AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
	- WELL HE KILLS PEOPLE FOR A LIVING! HE DOESN'T HELP PEOPLE!!!
- The gang debates on whether or not we should follow Investigator Teasley
	- Camille just follows after the investigator bcs they're tired of all the arguing üíÄ -- the rest of the gang follows

# At The Garrison
- There are guards around chatting, some battle plans on the table, a handful of citizens sitting in chairs
	- BASICALLY a fantasy police office
	- *Looks like a bar turned into a garrison*
- Investigator Teasley sits at the head of a long table, and gestures for us to sit at either side of the table next to her
	- Cal is ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK leaning against the wall
	- Cordelia sits in the middle of the table
- TEASLEY KNOWS VALLEN???
	- They knew each other in the capital
	- Vallen thinks they were on good term (Teasley's reaction says they were NOT LMAO)
- Anyways Teasley knows our deal (sans the vision stuff) -- so we technically report to her since we're contracted into the military now
- **What we tell Teasley:**
	- A vampire escaped from a nearby town, we're here to investigate it
	- The blue man who witnessed us
		- Camille shows her the picture LMAO
		- SHE'S BAFFLED THAT WE JUST LEFT A DEAD BODY ON THE STREET
- DID VALLEN AND TEASLEY FUCK???
	- yeah üòè
- Cordelia realizes that she killed a man yesterday and we left his body on the street
	- SHE STARTS WAILING!!!!
	- KAYA SLAPS HER AND TELLS HER TO GET HER SHIT TOGETHER
- **What Teasley tells us:**
	- What she says must NOT leave this room. If it does, then 
	- There are a dispatchment of vampires from a specific coven that the garrison is looking into
	- They're outside of town most nights
	- They usually don't approach the town, but they seem to be *searching for something or someone* (they believe it's something though)
	- The garrison doesn't know who they are though
	- Back in the day, there were multiple covens. But there was a SPECIFIC coven that were known to have **daywalkers: the [[Dagon Coven]]**. These are our main suspects
- Who would like to participate?
	- Camille wants to help
	- Cal is down for a good old fashioned vampire hunt
	- Kaya's just curious
	- Cordelia's uncertain -- BUT SHE'S IN! DESPITE THE RISKS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF NEEDING TO MURDER SOMEONE ELSE!!
- Teasley throws a knife at the door, which prompts a fully-plated guardsman to walk in and ask what the fuck is up (not literally tho)
	- She asks them to give us some more gold to buy supplies!!
- *We will meet back at the garrison at dusk*
- As we leave, one of the guards hands out pouches of **200 GP EACH**

# SHOPPING EPISODE PART 2
- Story Initiative
	- Kaya: 11
	- Cordelia: 9
	- Cal: 3
	- Camille: 2
## Brief Side-Conversation
- Cal is like "so you're just gonna be here all the time huhü§®?" LIKE HE'S TRYING TO PICK A FIGHT üòß
	- Cordelia tries to avoid conflict by asking where in the capital he's from
	- Vallen's gonna be here for a while, but *he's from the north*
		- Camille's also from the north! From the woods near Holden
			- THE GANG'S LIKE üòß
			- APPARENTLY THE WOODS NEAR HOLDEN ARE SUPER DANGEROUS. WHOOPSIE!
			- Camille makes it super uncomfy by talking about looking for dead bodies as children w/ their brother üòé
		- Camille insight (16) on Vallen's weird look @ them: he knows something about the woods that they don't ü§®

## Kaya Goes to the Blacksmith
- Kaya's looking for something silver -- preferably a staff or a spear
	- They're *5 GP a piece*
	- THIS DUDE'S GOT A FUCKTON OF SPEARS!!
- *Kaya orders 10 spears* bcs she can fit them in her bag of holding!!
	- It costs 50 GP
	- **It is a BONUS ACTION to pull objects out of a bag of holding**
- She compliments his beard üòä he grew it himself!!
	-  HE LIKES KAYA SO MUCH!!! YIPEE
	- HE SAYS THAT SHE SHOULD BRING HER FRIENDS!! SHE WILL
- His name is [[Durgen Coalbeard]]
	- He doesn't have very many friends :( IT'S OK BCS KAYA'S HIS HOMIE NOW!!!
- Lily: This is THE most wholesome thing Kaya's done this entire campaign
- Kaya bids goodbye to her new bestie and starts heading towards where the rest of the group is

## The Gang Buries a Body (Maybe 2)
- Camille asks Cordelia for some vials *so they can make holy water* later
	- It takes an hour to make a single vial, so they might need 4-5 vials (out of Cordelia's total of 12)
- Cal says that Vallen's shirt is nice, and asks if it comes in a men's size
	- WHY IS HE ALSO SEXIST :(
- Vallen asks Cal why he hates him
	- HE GETS IGNORED!!! DAMN
	- Camille whispers to Vallen that it might be because that he's from the Clover military and also a vampire
- We arrive at the house!! The door is boarded up and there are two guards standing on either side of the door
	- CORDELIA KNOCKS ON THE DOOR üò≠ THE GUARDS ARE RIGHT THERE!!!
	- One of the guards is very polite and opens the door for her
- Camille says a short prayer over the body (we can't bury it bcs it's under active investigation LMAO) and Cordelia helps by lighting a stick of incense
- Camille asks Vallen to come with them to Foo's bar so they can ask him some questions about vampire stuff while they make holy water
	- They ask Cordelia and Cal if they want to go buy supplies while they make holy water
- KAYA SHOWS BACK UP YIPEE!!
	- SHE SHOWS OFF HER NEW SPEARS AND IS SO EXCITED ABOUT HER NEW FRIEND
	- **Vallen seems to recognize Durgen Coalbeard's name?**
		- HE SEEMS TO FREAK OUT?? AND *BOLTS OUT THE DOOR*
		- CAMILLE FOLLOWS IMMEDIATELY
		- THE REST OF THE GANG FOLLOWS

# WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH DURGEN?
- Vallen bursts through the door of the blacksmith, and we hear yelling
- Insight to see what the yelling is about: pretty much everyone rolls high except for Cordelia üíÄ
	- IT'S HOMIES YELLING AT HOMIES. THANK GOD
- They're hugging omg.. I love friendship <3
- DURGEN THOUGHT VALLEN WAS DEAD!!!
- Kaya introduces us to Durgen!!
	- HE'S SURPRISED THAT KAYA HAS MORE THAN ONE FRIEND LMAO
	- He shakes everyone's hand :]
	- Camille agrees that Durgen is very fun and energetic -- he reminds them of their brother
- Vallen and Durgen were a part of the same adventuring party 100 years ago!!
- Durgen asks what we need silver weapons for! He doesn't usually ask his customers this, but we're a special case
- The gang orders stuff!
	- Cordelia: silver-tipped quarterstaff (7 GP; SHE PAYS HIM 40 GP)
	- Camille: silver dagger (7 GP as well; they give him 25 GP)
	- Cal asks to look at Durgen's magical weapons, Camille hops on that train
- Cal asks for [Daggers of Returning] -- he gets like 6 I think
	- Once he receives the daggers, he flips one and it disappears in a puff of black smoke!!
- For the extra 65 GP that we gave him, *Durgen will start crafting EACH of us a specialized weapon*
	- We will need to tell him what our ideal weapon is though!!
	- Cordelia wants either a staff or a wand
	- Kaya wants a pair of brass knuckles or a staff
	- Camille wants a staff? But isn't 100% sure bcs they don't use a ton of weapons
	- Cal wants a piece of armor!
- If Durgen isn't at the blacksmith's tomorrow don't fret! Because he's gonna be out buying our materials üòä
- Cordelia offers that Durgen join us for a drink at the bar sometime!!

- The gang splits up again!!


# Camille goes to the magic shop!
- The sign outside says "The Glimmering Nook"
- Interior Description:
	- Magical items - books, scrolls, curiosities, components, etc. - fill the shop
	- Tiefling dude at the counter!
		- Purple
		- Flambouyant
		- Reading out of a thick book, holding it in one hand
- Asks for magic items that help *defeat vampires*
	- NOT Vallen tho (the tiefling says to send his regards to him though!! Also says he's a bit awkward LMAO)
- Camille asks for an item to help immobilize vampires
- He has [five daylight stones]
	- Deal radiant damage OR can drop it at your feet to ward off vampires
	- IT'S FREE!!! (Camille still pays 10 GP)
	- *Bright light within 15 ft and dim light within 30 ft*
	- **Time limit: only lasts until the sun rises** 
- Do these stones work as well against daywalkers?
	- Not as well, but they'll do some damage
	- Vallen's the best person to ask about this kinda stuff though
- Daywalker Vampires are pretty weak!!
	- **Daywalkers also don't really drink blood???**
- Hands Camille a [blue vial]
	- **12 uses**, can ward vampires from biting your neck if you apply it to your neck
	- Paid for with the 10 GP from earlier
		- Camille tries to insist on paying, but the shopkeep says that they can just pay him back by telling him a story on how we defeat the vampire üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- SHOPKEEP LORE!!!
	- This dude was VERY surprised that Durgen's leaving his house (or is willing to leave his house)
	- Homie's met a vampire before?? ü§® oh word?
	- The shopkeep suggests that Camille ask Vallen about his time before (since he's been in the capital for a LONG time)
		- Vallen also visits the town every once in a while!!
- They're friends now!!! $YIPEE!!!$
	- This guy's name is [[Quivern Saltspark]] (but friends call him Quiv <3 )

# Back at the Bar
- It seems pretty lively!!
- Cordelia orders a salad (so a sandwich without bread LMAO)
- Camille comes in!
	- Says they made a new friend!!
- Camille asks Vallen about daywalkers: if they don't drink blood, why is someone from the daywalker tribe the main suspect?
	- The conclusion is that the vampire we're hunting is NOT a daywalker since they're hunting/attacking at night
	- Camille asks Vallen to share this kind of information next time, since not all of us are as well-versed in vampire stuff
- LORE DROP
	- [[Dagen]] is a *politician in the capital* and is suspected to be the leader of the clan we suspect we're dealing with
	- Not everyone in the [[Dagen Coven]] are daywalkers
- HISTORY CHECK FOR CAPITAL KNOWLEDGE
	- *Dagen is the Baron of Holden* (known by Cordelia and Kaya)
		- In terms of family hierarchy, barons are influential and would be someone Cordelia's family would want to impress
		- *He throws lavish parties once every few years*
		- There are a lot of conspiracies surrounding him, but nothing ever sticks
	- Cal has heard the name "Dagen" before when hunting other vampires
- Cal asks why we don't just kill Dagen since we suspect him of being a big vampire ringleader
	- The best bet would be to build a case against him, since he has lots of security and fame
- WE GET BLTS FROM FOO!!! (Cordelia just gets tomato, lettuce, and a plain burger on the side LMAO)
	- Cal asks if he can have the plain burger LMAO
- Camille pulls out the blue vial they got from Quivern
	- VALLEN $HATES$ THE WAY IT SMELLS!!! SORRY BRO
	- It smells like burning flesh to him
- Camille passes on Quivern's regards to Vallen!!
	- Camille also urges Vallen to make friends LMAO
- What does Vallen know about the forest near Holden?
	- *That's where Dagen dumps his bodies* üò¨
- VALLEN LORE
	- He was kept in the [[Clover Capital|Capital]] as basically a dog and followed orders
	- Was fed people :(
	- Switched to being a daywalker about 50 years ago
- Camille asks Cal to make some stakes for stabbing
	- Kaya asks Foo if it's ok if she shaves her spears and shit at the table (she gets the a-ok!!)
- Camille makes some holy water!!
	- The ritual takes an hour and 10 minutes per vial
	- *They manage to make 3 vials of holy water*
