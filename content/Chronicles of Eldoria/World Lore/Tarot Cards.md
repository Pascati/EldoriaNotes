- ***Contain knowledge of spells that are able to to beyond the 9th level***
- Only 2 card-users can exist at a time
	- This is to ensure that the knowledge of these spells are passed down to future generations
- [[Mystra]] doesn't like these cards because they *call upon the powers of other gods* -- not just the power of the Weave
	- Unlike the Weave, Mystra cannot control the other gods
	- Mystra is inclined to prevent card-users from growing too powerful (by killing them)
