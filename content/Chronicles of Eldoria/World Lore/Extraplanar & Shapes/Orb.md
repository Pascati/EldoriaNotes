- One of the [[Shapes of Paracausality]]
- The Yin to the [[Pyramid]]'s Yang
	- Wants to *nourish and preserve life*
- Anyone who touches it - other than [[The Keeper]] - is made a *host to alien life*
	- So far, this life has been fuzzy pink moss! (Appears on the body part that touched it?)
	- Of the party, only [[Cordelia Elysian|Cordelia]] and [[Camille Xotli|Camille]] have been in contact with it (as of [[Session 17]])
- Currently in [[The Keeper]]'s possession (briefly teleported into [[Camille Xotli|Camille's]] bag due to a fatal injury they suffered)
- Was originally "asleep", but was likely awoken when [[Camille Xotli|Camille]] took fatal damage in [[Session 17|the battle of Lycoris]]
