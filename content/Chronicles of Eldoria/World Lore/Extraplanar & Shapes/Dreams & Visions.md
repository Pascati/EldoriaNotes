- Started in [[Session 01]], with [[Cordelia Elysian|Cordelia]] being the first of [[The Party]] to receive one
- ***NATURE OF THE DREAMS***
	- Two of the [[Shapes of Paracausality]] (the [[Orb]] and the [[Pyramid]]) are able to send us dreams, which are like visions of a potential future
	- [[The Curator]] is able to interfere with these visions/dreams to a certain extent (in that he can prevent us from having a bad one and instead have our minds spend the night in a peaceful pocket dimension), although he is not all-powerful and cannot do this all the time

# Contents of the dreams
## Dream 1
- Occurred during [[Session 01]]
- In the first dream (only experienced by [[Cordelia Elysian|Cordelia]]), she saw:
	- The ground covered in bodies and blood, with fire all around her
	- A cloaked man floating in the sky
		- As the man turned to her, he felt as if *"it"* was all her fault
## Dream 2
- Occurred during [[Session 02]]
- In the second dream, all 3 party members (pre-Cal era):
	- Find themselves in a foggy area, and feel as if they are sitting in water (2-3 inches deep)
	- See dead trees in the far, far distance
	- Hear the sound of metal grinding against metal (echoes and feels arcane, like the metals are magic)
	- Cannot speak or move
- The party hears a voice say ***"I had strings... But now I am free."***
	- A gauntleted hand grabs their shoulders, and the dream ended

## Dream 3
- Occurred during [[Session 03]]
### Part 1
- Had by the main party (Camille, Kaya, Cordelia)
- The party:
	- Opens their eyes in a swamp-ish area
	- Sees a hooded individual with a flowing cloak very far away
	- Walk towards the figure, but stop partway
- The figure in the distance shakes a little, and the same gauntleted hand grabs the party's shoulders
	- The hand moves up and forces the party to look skywards
- In the sky is a [[Pyramid|black, upside-down pyramid inscribed with red runes]]
	- The tip of the pyramid glows red and a beam shoots out of it, hitting the ground and cracking it open
### Part 2
- Had by Cal (alone)
- Cal dreamed of an abandoned, destroyed city, in which buildings were on fire and he was surrounded by bodies
- He saw a cloaked figure floating in the sky
- As Cal raised his hand, blood fell from the sky
- As revealed in [[Session 06]], Cordelia realized that this dream is the very first one she had (that NO ONE ELSE HAD) from [[Session 01]]

## Dream 4
- Occurred during [[Session 06]]; the first instance of one of [[The Curator]]'s dreams!
- The party found themselves in the same swamp, but then a white slash split through reality
	- The party was then transported to a sunny meadow filled with pinkish-blueish flowers, with a the broken-down ruins of a chapel nearby
	- Flowers that are picked regrow
	- In this setting, the party can move freely and speak to each other
- Within the chapel, the party meets [[The Curator]] for the first time, who reveals:
	- That he curates dreams/visions created by the [[Orb]] and [[Pyramid]], and why we have been receiving dreams (the [[Orb]] wants to prepare us for the future, while the [[Pyramid]] is more enigmatic and acts of its own volition, moreso than the [[Orb]]. It is later revealed in [[Session 17]] that the [[Orb]] is able to make its own choices as well, although such actions were limited to after its awakening)
	- [[The Keeper]] has been chosen to study the [[Orb]], but not to know the future
	- The [[Orb]] has chosen us to prevent what the [[Pyramid]] is planning
	- Namedrops the [[Shapes of Paracausality]]
		- They are called this because they donâ€™t abide by our laws of nature
- The party is told to escape through a door (massive portal that looks like a mirror) before the [[Pyramid]] is able to take over control of the dream

## Dream 5
- Occurred during [[Session 07]]
- The party receives a vision of [[Holden]]
	- First we see a scene of the banquet/masquerade we're going to attend
	- Then the scene changes to a massive tomb filled with wires and machinery (much like Foo's secret room but WAY bigger)
		- There's a drawing of an [[Pyramid|upright triangle]] painted on a piece of parchment in the room
- The party doesn't see each other, but we all see the same thing

## Dream 6
- Occurred during [[Session 09]]
- The party meets [[The Curator]] again! He tells us that:
	- We're *really close* to either the [[Pyramid]] itself, or someone who has recently touched the Pyramid/been in close proximity to it
	- The source of this signal (either the Pyramid or the person) is in [[Holden]], the party's current destination
- [[The Curator]]'s book is revealed to be something that only he can read (out of everyone present), and that its contents are hard to explain

## Dream 7
- Occurred during [[Session 14]]
- The party sees the [[Clover Capital|the Capital]] in the distance
- The same figure from before appears
	- This time it's closer (within 50 ft.)
	- The figure is holding the [[Pyramid]]
- Suddenly the Capital erupts in explosions and is on fire

## Dream 8
- Occurred during [[Session 16]]
- As the party falls asleep, there's a flash of red and purple
- The party finds themselves standing on the surface of the water in the same swamp as usual
- The same figure floats in the distance, cape flapping in the wind -- it slowly approaches us and stops ~100 ft away
	- As it approaches, we realize the figure is a *humanoid-looking [[Warforged]]*
- As the dream ends, we all wonder if the warforged figure is what [[OSIRIS]] is going to look like

## Dream 9
- Occurred during [[Session 17]]
- Another dream from [[The Curator]]! He tells us about the third [[Shapes of Paracausality]]: the [[Cube]]
	- The Cube is like the "tapestry"/box which is intended to contain both the [[Pyramid]] and the [[Orb]]
	- It is hiding *outside of our reality* in an <u>extradimensional space/pocket dimension</u>
		- It was hidden away so the gods and people can *restore/reset the world* in case one of the shapes goes out of control
	- When housing the Pyramid and the Orb, it can be used to ***shape reality***
- [[The Curator]]:
	- Asks us to deliver the Pyramid and Orb to him, so he can use them together with the Cube to prevent [[the Cataclysm]]
	- Tells us that the Pyramid wants to scare us into its path of destruction, while the Orb wants to promote us to its path of life

## Dream 10
- [[Session 18]]
- The party is standing side-by-side on a rocky beach, with the [[Fog]] in the distance (the [[Fog]], as always, is streaked with red and purple lightning)
- Vallen and a masculine-looking figure (wearing a long coat) stand on a small peninsula nearby
	- There's a flash of light and *Vallen falls over*


# Theories
- The armored figure we see in dreams sent by the [[Pyramid]] appears to be [[OSIRIS]]
