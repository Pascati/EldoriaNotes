# The Great War
- In the final room of the dungeon encountered during [[Session 08]], Cordelia read ancient runes which told *two separate stories*, each of which occupied opposite sides of the room and <u>ended in the middle of the room</u> (each story seemed to end at the same time, i.e. at <u>present day</u>):
    - STORY 1: There was a big war, after which the land was split into four kingdoms (the kingdoms we know of today), ending with “and now”
    - STORY 2: “We made the fog” … “Four kingdoms” … “split” … “and now”
        - Both “and now”s end at the same spot
    - **On both sides of the room (i.e. in both stories), there is the phrase “world machine”**
        - Lily is theorizing that this is like DiskWorld -- the fog is protecting us from the edge of the world (flat earth style) 🌏👀
