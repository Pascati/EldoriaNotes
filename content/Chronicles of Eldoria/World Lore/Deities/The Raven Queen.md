- Akin to a goddess of death
- Reigns over a plane of existence called the "Shadowlands" (i.e. the Shadowfell)
- Whenever she finds someone she deems interesting, she lays claim to their soul
	- This way, when the person dies, she can have them relieve their memories in the Shadowlands (like a movie)
- ALWAYS gets what she wants
- It's warned not to pray to her -- whatever power she offers is not worth one's soul
