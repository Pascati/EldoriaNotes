## Factions/Affiliations
- ???
- [[Foo]] (good acquaintances or friends)
- [[Vallen The Immortal]] (once worked together on a mission in Diamond)

# Known Information
- Was first encountered in [[Session 18]], when he asked after [[Kaya Avarice|Kaya]]
	- He heavily implied that Kaya is not from the continent of [[Eldoria]] (said that "these kingdoms" are not "her kingdom")
	- Seemed to know more about Kaya than he was willing to let on -- the vibe was almost like a proud older family member? Like a "you've grown so much and gotten so strong" kinda vibe
- Has a multi-dimensional key that can be used on [[Foo's doors]] (like ours!), but it wasn't given to him by [[Foo]] himself

# Appearances
