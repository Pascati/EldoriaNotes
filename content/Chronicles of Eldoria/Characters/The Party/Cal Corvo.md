# Known Information
- Traveled solo for 4 years before encountering and joining the Party
- In [[Session 08]], he shared a happy memory in which - on his fourteenth birthday - his parents decided that he was old enough to go into the big city with the merchants
	 - Since then, he was able to go once a month for the next two-ish years
	 - In the city, he learned that there were more exciting things that he could do other than farming
- Was experimented on by [[Caduceus Pope|Dr. Pope]] (learned in [[Session 16]])

## History
- Grew up in a small village right outside of [[Holden]]
- While traveling with the merchants (mentioned above), he learned about the [[Diamond Military]] and wanted to join
	- He argued about this decision with his parents for 2 years, eventually leaving at 16 on terrible terms (called his father a coward and his mother cried)
- Was recruited by [[Erin Thorne]] to the [[Seven Lieutenants|Seven of Diamond]]
	- Worked as one of [[Seven Lieutenants|The Seven]] for *5 years*
	- Their main job was to help [[Caduceus Pope|Dr. Pope]] and protect the people -- taking care of bandits, corrupt politicians, and generally helping the people
		- At the time, Dr. Pope was much more kind and curious (he just wanted to help people!)
	- Cal got boiled frog syndromed and eventually became numb to the idea of hurting/killing one person to save hundreds
- One night, he and the rest of the Seven were out retrieving "assets" for Dr. Pope, and Cal was ordered to keep watch
	- Eventually the rest of the Seven brought out multiple children, and realizing what they were doing Cal froze -- he couldn't stop them
	- A witness screamed and alerted everyone to the Seven kidnapping children, causing [[Erin Thorne|Thorne]] to kill the entire village to avoid the word from spreading and tarnishing their reputation
		- At the time, Cal could do nothing but run.
- Cal ran back to his hometown, only to find it had been burned to the ground years ago
	- He picked some flowers his mother grew and vowed to never fight again or let himself become someone else's puppet again
- He eventually settled down in [[Oakheart]], and grew carrots and potatoes from his old village
	- Eventually Thorne and two of the The Seven showed up again, claiming that Cal was *"too important to the army"*, which is why they *burned down his village so he **wouldn't have anywhere to go back to***
	- Cal was PISSED but told Thorne to leave, since he committed himself to pacifism
- Several hours after Thorne left, [[Oakheart]] was aflame
	- Cal ran into the city and killed the three of them (Thorne was thrown into a burning building, which collapsed on him)
	- The people of [[Oakheart]] praised him as a hero for this, not realizing that he was the reason why their homes burned.
- Afterwards, Cal decided to never stay in one place for too long, because [[Diamond Military|Diamond's army]] would always track him down. Since then, he's committed himself to helping real people, using violence or not.
