# Known Information
- Occupations
	- Currently serving as the party's bodyguard
	- [[The Keeper]]'s right-hand man
- Due to his deal with [[Lathander]], he is effectively immortal (revealed in [[Session 16]])
- His parents were tieflings! He was adopted :]
- His "vamp out" ability (when he freaked seeing Camille and Cal go down in [[Session 17]]) is something that's only really had by vampire lords
	- He doesn't know much about it since he doesn't drink a lot of (humanoid) blood
	- He also can't really control it

## History
- Originally born in Diamond (revealed in [[Session 07]])
- When he was 18 - roughly 312 years ago - he enlisted in the [[Diamond Military]] as per his father's wishes -- he was *very* good at what he did
- When he was 26, he met a young human woman at a bar and had a son with her
- On his 31st birthday, he was ambushed, captured, and tortured by vampires for information on [[Oakheart]]. When initially telling this story, the reason for him being ambushed was because he was drinking on the job.
	- This ended in the vampires killing him.
	- [[Kanchelsis]], the god of vampirism, brought him back as a vampire because he was a very devout follower of [[Lathander]] (as a way of saying ðŸ–• to him) -- later retellings of this story imply that Vallen's resurrection was more consensual than that though, since in [[Session 18]] he says he was "approached" by them
- Vallen took his newfound vampiric powers to Oakheart where he wreaked havoc, killed the vampires who killed him, and found his parents' bodies.
- After his revenge, he begged Lathander to take his life too
	- However, Lathander refused, saying that his job wasn't done. As long as Vallen killed monsters, his job wasn't done.
	- At that moment, he forged a contract with Lathander. As long as he kills monsters, he cannot die in a way that matters.
		- It's been ~300 years, and he hasn't heard Lathander's voice since then
- After being "told off" by Lathander, he joined the [[Clover Military]]
- At some point between then and ~50 years ago, he was kept in [[Clover Capital|the Capital]] as little more than a dog -- he could only ever follow orders, and was fed people :(
	- After escaping his situation, he switched to being a daywalker (non-people eater). This was about 50 years ago.

## Family
- Father & Mother
	- Worshipped Lathander (or at least his father did)
	- Killed by vampires ~300 years ago
