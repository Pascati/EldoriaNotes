- Raised in [[Clover Capital|the Capital]]
- On her seventh birthday (originally was her 11th birthday, but was likely retconned), she received the [[Tarot Cards]] as a gift from her grandfather
	- None of the other schools of magic called to her at the time, even though she knew that she was destined for a life of arcane academia. Despite that, [[Tarot Cards|the cards]] called to her. They felt *right*.
	- She had gotten into a terrible fight with [[Cordelia's Mother|her mother]] that day -- it was also the last birthday she spent with her grandfather
		- In her grandfather's final hours, she asked him where he got the cards from: a traveling merchant he met - who sold bits and bobs - offered the cards to him after hearing that it was his daughter's seventh birthday
- Was among the first to attend [[Capital University]] after it was built
