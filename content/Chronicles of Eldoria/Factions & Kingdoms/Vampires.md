- Vampire lore/functionality:
	- Most can't walk in sunlight
		- The only exceptions so far are *daywalkers* and vampires who use *shadow boxes* (little devices which cloak the user's body in complete shadow)
	- Must drink blood to survive
		- *Daywalkers* cannot drink humanoid blood, otherwise they lose their ability to walk in the sun. All other vampires are able to drink humanoid blood.
- Drink blood, which can be used for multiple purposes
	- One of which is to get drunk, and another of which is to get an erection :(
	- The above was learned in [[Session 11]]

# Known Sub-Factions
- [[Dagen Coven]] (largely extinct due to the Party's actions)
