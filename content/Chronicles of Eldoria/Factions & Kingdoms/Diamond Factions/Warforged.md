- Created by [[Caduceus Pope]], and introduced in [[Session 09]] at [[Dagen's Masquerade]]
- Originally created to serve in the [[Diamond Military]]
	- As of [[Session 19]], [[The Keeper|V]] suspects that they have started to diverge from their original purpose (due to the presence of many high-ranking military officials in the Diamond military during the battle of [[Lycoris]] and them not sporting any Diamond insignias)
- As of [[Session 18]], the party discovered that some warforged are sentient in the way that they have differing opinions and desires
	- **IZZIE THEORY:** They either contain artificial souls or the souls of Diamond citizens (if the latter is true, then they were likely mind-wiped so they don't remember much or anything of their previous life as a flesh-and-blood person)
