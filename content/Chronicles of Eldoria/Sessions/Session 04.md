# WE GET FUCKASS [[Dreams & Visions|DREAMS]]
- We all fall asleep pretty quickly!
- In our dreams, Cordelia, Kaya, and Camille open their eyes to a vast foggy expanse (swampish area)
- If we open our mouths, no sound comes out
- There is a hooded individual with a flowing cloak very far away
- The three of us begin to walk towards the figure, but then we suddenly freeze in place
	- The figure in the distance shakes a little
	- We feel a gauntleted hand grab our shoulders -- but this time, **we don't wake up.**
	- The gauntleted hand moves up, making us look upwards
- We see a **black, upside-down [[Pyramid]]**, inscribed with red runes
	- The tip of the [[pyramid]] begins to glow red
	- It shoots a red beam into the ground, cracking it open

## Cal [[Dreams & Visions|Dreams]]
- Cal opens his eyes to an abandoned, destroyed city. Buildings are aflame and he is surrounded by bodies
- There is a cloaked figure floating in the sky
- Blood seems to fall from the sky as he raises his hand

# Bad Morning

- We recap our dream (it was BAD)

	- As [[Foo]] leaves, Cal calls out to him and asks for him to bring a "young virgin" for [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] to drink
	- Camille takes offense to that
- [[Vallen The Immortal|VALLEN]] LORE
	- About 300 years ago, he wanted to join the military (as a young boy)
	- He wanted to protect Clover!
	- On his 31st birthday, he was ambushed by vampires - and because he was drinking on the job, which he shouldn't have been - they got the best of him

	- LILY: "WE ARE GOING A SOMEWHERE"
- Cal calls out to us as the townsman sprints towards his house, saying that we have a chance to trap the vampire since it's daylight
	- We follow!! So does [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] (catches up to Cal pretty easily, but stays within 10 ft)
