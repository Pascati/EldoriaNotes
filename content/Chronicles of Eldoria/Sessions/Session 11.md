- Celia is here to visit! huzzah!!!
    - LILY KEEPS FARTING ON HER :( VICTIM!!!!!!

# Starting a New Day!!
- We don‚Äôt have any bad dreams!!
    - nvm I fuck it up by asking if I can roll for bad dreams
    - NVM MY NVM!! WE STAY WINNING!!!
- We make our way to the mess hall for breakfast
    - [[Foo|Foo]] SERVES US BREAKFAST ü§©
    - Note: [[Camille Xotli|Camille]] doesn‚Äôt drink coffee (and doesn‚Äôt drink a ton) -- homie‚Äôs rawdogging life
- [[The Keeper]] stops by our table
    - He‚Äôll get us our 1,000 GP each bonus once we leave
    - We can leave from the Garrison using [[Foo]]‚Äôs Key (he will meet us there)
- [[Cal Corvo|Cal]] has a problem with our current mission
    - He‚Äôs not okay with it at all -- he doesn‚Äôt want to take orders anymore, and if he‚Äôs going to be doing something, he wants to know when things are happening, why they‚Äôre happening, and what the endgoal is
    - He‚Äôs ok with working _with_ people, so long as their goals are aligned and they‚Äôre working towards a common cause
    - Cal doesn‚Äôt think _anyone_ should have the [[Pyramid]], much less the Keeper
        - What‚Äôs the Keeper planning on doing with the Pyramid?? unknown
        - Can the [[Orb]]/Pyramid be destroyed?? unknown
- Our best bet of finding the Pyramid is [[Caduceus Pope|Dr. Pope]], since we know he worked with it last
    - Camille notes that the best way to find Dr. Pope is to find the vampire that took him, and we _know_ someone who has to stay close to the vampire in question ([[Garrett]]) AND we have a way to contact him
- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] suggests that we ask questions and learn as much as we can first - without revealing our opinions or intentions - before we decide what to do next
    - He doesn‚Äôt want power to be in the wrong hands
    - He trusts the Keeper because of what he‚Äôs done, not for what he will do

## Speaking to the Keeper
- We head downstairs to the Garrison -- the Keeper is there, leaning against the front desk and chatting with someone. When he sees us, he gestures for us to follow him and he goes to a back room
    - We go through like 2 other doors. The second of which is an ornate stone door with a keyhole next to it (this is where we can use Foo‚Äôs Key!)
    - He doesn‚Äôt know how many charges the key has right now (**it recharges every day, and it has a max of 2 charges per day**)
- Camille asks if we have to leave now. The answer is no, but the Keeper has nothing else to speak with us about
    - Cal does though!!
- Cal asks what the Keeper‚Äôs plan/play is
    - Now is not the time to be talking about it, according to the Keeper
    - The Keeper feels as if there‚Äôs a missing peace -- like how Yin and Yang come together to make perfectly balanced peace, the Pyramid and the Orb probably come together to create something
    - Cal says ‚Äúabsolute power corrupts absolutely‚Äù (real as shit)
        - The Keeper reminds us that he touched the Orb without protection. ***The shapes don‚Äôt appear to affect him***
        - When [[Captain Purah|Purah]] touched the Orb, she felt the urge to protect every living being -- knowing that the shapes are diametrically opposed, the Pyramid likely makes people feel like they want to kill/hurt every living being
    - The Keeper asks who the shapes should rest with: someone who can be influenced by them, or someone who isn‚Äôt affected by them at all?
        - Cal believes they shouldn‚Äôt be owned by anyone. They should be destroyed, in his opinion
    - **The Keeper issues Cal a challenge: if he can figure out a way to destroy the Pyramid, then go ahead. But if he can‚Äôt, he should bring it back and let the Keeper destroy it**
        - Cal agrees to this. But at the first sign of being ‚Äúfucked over‚Äù, he will immediately turn.
    - The Keeper encourages us to _not_ bring him the Pyramid if his interests ever not align with ours or have the best interest of the people in mind
- The Keeper reminds us that we can contact him any time with the prototype sending stone -- he has one exactly like ours
    - He also notes that [[Ozwin|Oz]] is insisting that he is able to decide our adventures (remember that he was the one who approved our vampire adventure), but the Keeper is pushing back
- Camille asks if we can stay in the Capital for a little while before we head back -- Cal is also amicable to this, since neither of them have been in the Capital with free reign before
- We discuss the logistics of using Foo‚Äôs Key
    - It can ONLY be used on doors that match the door we‚Äôre currently in front of
- Vallen says we should head back to [[Hillford]] once we‚Äôre done exploring [[Clover Capital|the Capital]]

# Exploring the Capital
- Camille wants to wander!!
    - [[Cordelia Elysian|Cordelia]] warns that they might get lost -- they‚Äôre ok with that. She _does_ suggest a good bakery though!
- On the way to the bakery, Cal is giving out gold coins to EVERY homeless person we pass by
- Camille starts veering off from the group, going towards a VERY high-end jewelry shop
    - Everyone convinces Camille to not go inside (there are probably cheaper places to get diamonds, such as the magic shop back in Hillford)
    - There‚Äôs a homeless man in front of the shop (Cal gives him a GP! [[Kaya Avarice|Kaya]] gives two extra üòé)

## The Bakery
- The bakery is run by siblings (one is a dude and one is a HEAVILY pregnant lady!! They both have tan complexions and pink hair)
    - [[Island|The man (Island?)]] recognizes Cordelia!! He seems to be in the know about her deal with the wedding and why she left the Capital
    - The woman is named [[Aria]]. She says ‚Äúwelcome home‚Äù ü•∫
- Cordelia recaps a little of what‚Äôs happened with us over the past week or so
    - She visited [[Cordelia's Mother|her mother‚Äôs]] home roughly a week ago, and it went poorly
    - Kaya pipes up and says we‚Äôve been on a ‚Äúmagical girl journey‚Äù
    - Cordelia doesn‚Äôt know where her mother is, neither does Island. Apparently she stopped by the bakery, grabbed a few things, and left
        - It‚Äôs a bit odd because normally she sends her butler to fetch things, rather than making appearance on her own
        - She didn‚Äôt say much, kinda brushed off Island when he tried to make conversation
    - [[Lawrence Elysian|Lawrence (Cordelia‚Äôs brother)]] stops by often though!!
        - Cordelia doesn‚Äôt want to see him right now. Not because she doesn‚Äôt like him, but because it‚Äôs been a crazy few weeks and she doesn‚Äôt want to do all that explaining
        - It‚Äôs ok bcs he‚Äôs already stopped by for today
    - Cordelia drops the lore that we technically work for the Military as Ambassadors
- WE GET PASTRIES ON THE HOUSE!!! HUZZAH
    - Cal and Camille are PUMPED about getting fruity little tarts and danishes (Cal gets pigs in a blanket too)
    - Camille gets a cheese danish
    - [[Kaya Avarice|Kaya]] requests a blueberry muffin
    - Cordelia gets a moonberry tart
- Island ALMOST suggests that Cordelia takes us to the university, but that might be a bad idea
    - Classes haven‚Äôt started yet so we probably won‚Äôt be allowed there
- What are Cordelia‚Äôs plans?
    - She doesn‚Äôt really know
    - She‚Äôs fine with Island mentioning to Lawrence that she‚Äôs been by
- **NOTE: Vallen is probably lactose intolerant (according to CJ). He also canonically shits.**
- Camille tries to leave the bakery siblings money (it does NOT work. Cal ends up taking the 2 GP üíÄ)

# Returning to Hillford
- Vallen mentions that our weapons might be done (back in Hillford) so we head back!! We can always do more sightseeing later
- Camille is currently holding Foo‚Äôs Key, so they unlock the door (it‚Äôs a pull door not a push door)
    - At first all they see is a brick wall, but eventually a glowing mote expands into a long blue hallway
    - Camille walks through first and disappears -- at the other end of the hallway is a wooden door. When they open it, they enter the tavern!! (through the basement door leading into the tavern)
- WE‚ÄôRE IN THE TAVERN!!
    - Foo greets us and asks us if the key works (it does!)
    - **WE ALSO GET OUR 1,000 GP BONUS**

## Reuniting with [[Durgen Coalbeard|Durgen]]
- OUR STUFF IS DONE!! HUZZAHHH
- Kaya receives the **Knuckles of Life Stealing (attunement)**
    - They‚Äôre like leather gloves with silver plating, with small spikes on each finger and knuckle
    - They have a max of 4 charges, and gain a charge with each successful unarmed attack. After reaching 4 charges, she can heal (currently 2d4)

    - He‚Äôs been working with the magic shop as of late!
        - The magic shop also has new items üëÄ
    - DURGEN HAS A SHIPMENT OF FIREARMS COMING IN???
- Durgen‚Äôs also been able to fix the _Daggers of Returning_!! There are little buttons on the back to deactivate them
    - He‚Äôs willing to sell them at a SIGNIFICANT discount (250 each) in exchange for an IOU favor that he‚Äôll cash in later
        - Some shipments have been going missing lately -- we might have to look for them later

## Going to the Tailor‚Äôs
- [[Varrell DeFontaine|Varrell]] is excited to see us!! He has Cal‚Äôs item ready to go: it‚Äôs **a very nice suit (Armor of Convenience)**
    - As he takes the hanger from Varrell, he notices it‚Äôs a little heavier than expected
    - It‚Äôs a **light armor** that can _change_
    - It gives him +2 AC and can alter its appearance twice a day
- Cordelia‚Äôs blue dress is done!! A **Cloak of Stars** was used to make it
    - This dress will allow her to cast an additional first level spell once a day!!
- Varrell‚Äôs new assistant will arrive tomorrow!!

    - The stable (the Whistlewind) is being taken over by someone from [[Crossroads]] (THE [[Reema|ORC LADY]] THAT KAYA BEEFED IT IN FRONT OF)
- Cordelia accidentally lets it slip about Foo‚Äôs interdimensional door
    - IT‚ÄôS OK SHE SAVES IT WITH A GOOD DECEPTION ROLL
- Cordelia is also looking for:
    - A ring that would allow her to locate objects

    - Sending Stones
        - Camille purchases 4 sending stones (25 GP each)
        - **So long as you have a sending stone, you can receive sending stone messages (like a text message). If you _don‚Äôt_ have a sending stone, you CAN‚ÄôT receive messages. If you use a sending stone, it gets consumed in the casting**

    - **From Oz: I‚Äôm coming to Hillford, I‚Äôll be there in the morning.**
        - Cordelia cannot respond to this message due to the nature of sending stones (I forgor the specifics)
    - Camille is nervous about Oz, and theorizes that he‚Äôs here to meet with us behind the Keeper‚Äôs back to get us to do things
        - Vallen trusts Oz, and says that he generally does things behind the Keeper‚Äôs back because he can‚Äôt be everywhere at once
- Cordelia tries to rizz Vallen up by doing a coin trick

    - We tell them how to pass through
    - Camille tells Quiv - after learning that he would never sleep outside - that they can teach him how to ‚Äúpitch a tent‚Äù (unknowing of the connotation)
- There‚Äôs talk about shitting pants and farting. CJ says ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt Prestidigitate your dignity back!‚Äù
- PERCEPTION CHECK
    - CAMILLE GETS A NAT 20

    - Cordelia takes 2 shots (she‚Äôs a lightweight üíÄ)
- Cordelia says Camille is really nice (compared to the rest of the party)

    - She succeeds ü§©
- WE TALK MORE ABOUT VALLEN DRINKING OUR BLOOD

    - He probably shouldn‚Äôt drink any of our blood though because that‚Äôll fuck up his ability to walk in the sun

# Morning Comes
- We wake up (we were too drunk to have dreams)
- Everyone (except for Camille) rolls to see if they have hangovers
    - Nobody wakes up with a hangover üòé we stay winning!!
- Ozwin is downstairs, smoking a pipe
- Vallen is nowhere to be found
    - Not in kitchen, not in rooms
    - Camille casts ==Sending== and checks in -- lets him know that Ozwin is here, that he doesn‚Äôt have to come, but they hope he‚Äôs alive
    - Vallen‚Äôs Message Back: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my way back‚Äù

## Meeting with Ozwin
- **Reason why Ozwin‚Äôs in town**
    - The Keeper‚Äôs thought it over, and he‚Äôs decided that Ozwin should be our point of contact + he will be giving us orders from now on
    - Everyone rolls insight on this
        - Seems to be telling the truth
    - His goal is to help us find the Pyramid and point us in the right direction -- this time he‚Äôs running everything by the Keeper (unlike the last mission we went on)
        - INSIGHT REVEALS THAT HE _KNEW_ DR. POPE WAS GONNA BE THERE
- Dr. Pope is a touchy subject
    - **Dr. Pope used to be a Clover operative, before he defected to Diamond**
    - Clover wanted to have ethical inventions, and testing on people in the Capital isn‚Äôt permitted (hence why he defected to Diamond)
- Cal asks if Ozwin is implying that Dr. Pope was involved in human experimentation
    - Yeah.. Cal‚Äôs disappointed
- **OZWIN‚ÄôS REQUEST**
    - He needs us to go to [[Mossley]]
    - **There are reports of a Warforged ‚Äúobserving‚Äù in Mossley** -- there‚Äôs suspicion of Diamond maybe using this as an entry point into Clover
    - **Our job isn‚Äôt to fight them, but to observe the battle (not to engage ourselves) and check if our connection to the shape _happens_**
    - Some of Ozwin‚Äôs people are already on their way. Once we hear back from them, then we can move out
    - Ozwin suggests that we head back to the Capital later today to get a head start
    - If we get close enough, we can kill the Warforged. But that shouldn‚Äôt be our main priority
    - Ozwin can‚Äôt come with us (there are too many things he has to set up in town)
- Where‚Äôs [[Nicholas Powers|Nick Powers]]?
    - Still off looking for Cal -- exact whereabouts unknown
    - Cordelia starts gaslighting Ozwin into believing Nicholas‚Äôs surname is ‚ÄúBottom‚Äù
        - Ozwin mentions that he might let the codex and Mercenary‚Äôs Guild know about the name change
- We should use our Sending Stone to let the head honchos know that we‚Äôre on our way so they can put us on the right boat with the right crew
- Vallen comes back
    - HE SLEPT WITH FUCKING [[Investigator Teasley|TEASLEY]]. IT WAS NOT GOOD. üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
    - Camille does not approve. Largely because it doesn‚Äôt seem like Vallen had a good time :( homie deserves better than drunk sex with his ex
    - We fill Vallen in on Mossley
