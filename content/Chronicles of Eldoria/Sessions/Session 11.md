- Celia is here to visit! huzzah!!!
    - LILY KEEPS FARTING ON HER :( VICTIM!!!!!!

# Starting a New Day!!
- We don’t have any bad dreams!!
    - nvm I fuck it up by asking if I can roll for bad dreams
    - NVM MY NVM!! WE STAY WINNING!!!
- We make our way to the mess hall for breakfast
    - [[Foo|Foo]] SERVES US BREAKFAST 🤩
    - Note: [[Camille Xotli|Camille]] doesn’t drink coffee (and doesn’t drink a ton) -- homie’s rawdogging life
- [[The Keeper]] stops by our table
    - He’ll get us our 1,000 GP each bonus once we leave
    - We can leave from the Garrison using [[Foo]]’s Key (he will meet us there)
- [[Cal Corvo|Cal]] has a problem with our current mission
    - He’s not okay with it at all -- he doesn’t want to take orders anymore, and if he’s going to be doing something, he wants to know when things are happening, why they’re happening, and what the endgoal is
    - He’s ok with working _with_ people, so long as their goals are aligned and they’re working towards a common cause
    - Cal doesn’t think _anyone_ should have the [[Pyramid]], much less the Keeper
        - What’s the Keeper planning on doing with the Pyramid?? unknown
        - Can the [[Orb]]/Pyramid be destroyed?? unknown
- Our best bet of finding the Pyramid is [[Caduceus Pope|Dr. Pope]], since we know he worked with it last
    - Camille notes that the best way to find Dr. Pope is to find the vampire that took him, and we _know_ someone who has to stay close to the vampire in question ([[Garrett]]) AND we have a way to contact him
- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] suggests that we ask questions and learn as much as we can first - without revealing our opinions or intentions - before we decide what to do next
    - He doesn’t want power to be in the wrong hands
    - He trusts the Keeper because of what he’s done, not for what he will do

## Speaking to the Keeper
- We head downstairs to the Garrison -- the Keeper is there, leaning against the front desk and chatting with someone. When he sees us, he gestures for us to follow him and he goes to a back room
    - We go through like 2 other doors. The second of which is an ornate stone door with a keyhole next to it (this is where we can use Foo’s Key!)
    - He doesn’t know how many charges the key has right now (**it recharges every day, and it has a max of 2 charges per day**)
- Camille asks if we have to leave now. The answer is no, but the Keeper has nothing else to speak with us about
    - Cal does though!!
- Cal asks what the Keeper’s plan/play is
    - Now is not the time to be talking about it, according to the Keeper
    - The Keeper feels as if there’s a missing peace -- like how Yin and Yang come together to make perfectly balanced peace, the Pyramid and the Orb probably come together to create something
    - Cal says “absolute power corrupts absolutely” (real as shit)
        - The Keeper reminds us that he touched the Orb without protection. ***The shapes don’t appear to affect him***
        - When [[Captain Purah|Purah]] touched the Orb, she felt the urge to protect every living being -- knowing that the shapes are diametrically opposed, the Pyramid likely makes people feel like they want to kill/hurt every living being
    - The Keeper asks who the shapes should rest with: someone who can be influenced by them, or someone who isn’t affected by them at all?
        - Cal believes they shouldn’t be owned by anyone. They should be destroyed, in his opinion
    - **The Keeper issues Cal a challenge: if he can figure out a way to destroy the Pyramid, then go ahead. But if he can’t, he should bring it back and let the Keeper destroy it**
        - Cal agrees to this. But at the first sign of being “fucked over”, he will immediately turn.
    - The Keeper encourages us to _not_ bring him the Pyramid if his interests ever not align with ours or have the best interest of the people in mind
- The Keeper reminds us that we can contact him any time with the prototype sending stone -- he has one exactly like ours
    - He also notes that [[Ozwin|Oz]] is insisting that he is able to decide our adventures (remember that he was the one who approved our vampire adventure), but the Keeper is pushing back
- Camille asks if we can stay in the Capital for a little while before we head back -- Cal is also amicable to this, since neither of them have been in the Capital with free reign before
- We discuss the logistics of using Foo’s Key
    - It can ONLY be used on doors that match the door we’re currently in front of
- Vallen says we should head back to [[Hillford]] once we’re done exploring [[Clover Capital|the Capital]]

# Exploring the Capital
- Camille wants to wander!!
    - [[Cordelia Elysian|Cordelia]] warns that they might get lost -- they’re ok with that. She _does_ suggest a good bakery though!
- On the way to the bakery, Cal is giving out gold coins to EVERY homeless person we pass by
- Camille starts veering off from the group, going towards a VERY high-end jewelry shop
    - Everyone convinces Camille to not go inside (there are probably cheaper places to get diamonds, such as the magic shop back in Hillford)
    - There’s a homeless man in front of the shop (Cal gives him a GP! [[Kaya Avarice|Kaya]] gives two extra 😎)

## The Bakery
- The bakery is run by siblings (one is a dude and one is a HEAVILY pregnant lady!! They both have tan complexions and pink hair)
    - [[Island|The man (Island?)]] recognizes Cordelia!! He seems to be in the know about her deal with the wedding and why she left the Capital
    - The woman is named [[Aria]]. She says “welcome home” 🥺
- Cordelia recaps a little of what’s happened with us over the past week or so
    - She visited [[Cordelia's Mother|her mother’s]] home roughly a week ago, and it went poorly
    - Kaya pipes up and says we’ve been on a “magical girl journey”
    - Cordelia doesn’t know where her mother is, neither does Island. Apparently she stopped by the bakery, grabbed a few things, and left
        - It’s a bit odd because normally she sends her butler to fetch things, rather than making appearance on her own
        - She didn’t say much, kinda brushed off Island when he tried to make conversation
    - [[Lawrence Elysian|Lawrence (Cordelia’s brother)]] stops by often though!!
        - Cordelia doesn’t want to see him right now. Not because she doesn’t like him, but because it’s been a crazy few weeks and she doesn’t want to do all that explaining
        - It’s ok bcs he’s already stopped by for today
    - Cordelia drops the lore that we technically work for the Military as Ambassadors
- WE GET PASTRIES ON THE HOUSE!!! HUZZAH
    - Cal and Camille are PUMPED about getting fruity little tarts and danishes (Cal gets pigs in a blanket too)
    - Camille gets a cheese danish
    - [[Kaya Avarice|Kaya]] requests a blueberry muffin
    - Cordelia gets a moonberry tart
- Island ALMOST suggests that Cordelia takes us to the university, but that might be a bad idea
    - Classes haven’t started yet so we probably won’t be allowed there
- What are Cordelia’s plans?
    - She doesn’t really know
    - She’s fine with Island mentioning to Lawrence that she’s been by
- **NOTE: Vallen is probably lactose intolerant (according to CJ). He also canonically shits.**
- Camille tries to leave the bakery siblings money (it does NOT work. Cal ends up taking the 2 GP 💀)

# Returning to Hillford
- Vallen mentions that our weapons might be done (back in Hillford) so we head back!! We can always do more sightseeing later
- Camille is currently holding Foo’s Key, so they unlock the door (it’s a pull door not a push door)
    - At first all they see is a brick wall, but eventually a glowing mote expands into a long blue hallway
    - Camille walks through first and disappears -- at the other end of the hallway is a wooden door. When they open it, they enter the tavern!! (through the basement door leading into the tavern)
- WE’RE IN THE TAVERN!!
    - Foo greets us and asks us if the key works (it does!)
    - **WE ALSO GET OUR 1,000 GP BONUS**

## Reuniting with [[Durgen Coalbeard|Durgen]]
- OUR STUFF IS DONE!! HUZZAHHH
- Kaya receives the **Knuckles of Life Stealing (attunement)**
    - They’re like leather gloves with silver plating, with small spikes on each finger and knuckle
    - They have a max of 4 charges, and gain a charge with each successful unarmed attack. After reaching 4 charges, she can heal (currently 2d4)
    - IT WILL LEVEL UP WITH HER!!!

    - A mace covered in runic carvings, which spiral up the shaft and across the sphere

- Cal receives… well, nothing yet. **His item is with the tailor**
- [[Durgen Coalbeard|Durgen]] updates!!
    - He’s been working with the magic shop as of late!
        - The magic shop also has new items 👀
    - DURGEN HAS A SHIPMENT OF FIREARMS COMING IN???
- Durgen’s also been able to fix the _Daggers of Returning_!! There are little buttons on the back to deactivate them
    - He’s willing to sell them at a SIGNIFICANT discount (250 each) in exchange for an IOU favor that he’ll cash in later
        - Some shipments have been going missing lately -- we might have to look for them later

## Going to the Tailor’s
- [[Varrell DeFontaine|Varrell]] is excited to see us!! He has Cal’s item ready to go: it’s **a very nice suit (Armor of Convenience)**
    - As he takes the hanger from Varrell, he notices it’s a little heavier than expected
    - It’s a **light armor** that can _change_
    - It gives him +2 AC and can alter its appearance twice a day
- Cordelia’s blue dress is done!! A **Cloak of Stars** was used to make it
    - This dress will allow her to cast an additional first level spell once a day!!
- Varrell’s new assistant will arrive tomorrow!!
    - Kaya and Varrell dish about how shitty his previous assistant ([[Dox|“Cory”]]) was
    - HIS NAME IS [[Aiden|MR. AIDEN]]

    - Quiv has been invited to dinner (along with Durgen)
    - **The town is expanding!!!** There’s going to be a **new jeweler** and a **butcher’s shop**, at the very least
    - The stable (the Whistlewind) is being taken over by someone from [[Crossroads]] (THE [[Reema|ORC LADY]] THAT KAYA BEEFED IT IN FRONT OF)
- Cordelia accidentally lets it slip about Foo’s interdimensional door
    - IT’S OK SHE SAVES IT WITH A GOOD DECEPTION ROLL
- Cordelia is also looking for:
    - A ring that would allow her to locate objects
        - She is able to get a ring that will let her to locate an object within Hillford (as in within an area the size of Hillford) for 500 GP
    - Healing Potions
        - He can sell Potions of Greater Healing for 45 GP each (technically supposed to be 50)

        - Camille gets a 300 GP diamond for 150 GP!!
    - Magic tattoos? 👀
        - IT’S POSSIBLE! HUZZAH!!!
        - [[Unknown Saltspark|Quiv's brother]] can probably do it 👁️👁️ He’ll send a note to him tonight
    - Sending Stones
        - Camille purchases 4 sending stones (25 GP each)
        - **So long as you have a sending stone, you can receive sending stone messages (like a text message). If you _don’t_ have a sending stone, you CAN’T receive messages. If you use a sending stone, it gets consumed in the casting**

    - **From Oz: I’m coming to Hillford, I’ll be there in the morning.**
        - Cordelia cannot respond to this message due to the nature of sending stones (I forgor the specifics)
    - Camille is nervous about Oz, and theorizes that he’s here to meet with us behind the Keeper’s back to get us to do things
        - Vallen trusts Oz, and says that he generally does things behind the Keeper’s back because he can’t be everywhere at once
- Cordelia tries to rizz Vallen up by doing a coin trick
    - Vallen says the trick was impressive
- The gang takes an intermission irl

# Returning to Foo’s Bar

    - We sit at our usual table!
- THE GANG HAS DINNER (STEAK AND POTATOES)

- Quiv also comes in and sits at our table!!

    - They know _vaguely_ why the Capital’s in a tizzy (the vampires and warforged)
        - Camille tells them that we’ll probably die if we talk about it, so 😶
- State of the gang
    - Cal and Durgen are drunk as FUCK
    - Quiv’s getting into the drinks as well
- What’s Quiv’s deal?
    - Graduated from the university in the Capital (Transmutation)

    - When he arrived in Hillford, it was just the Foo Bar and a few houses
    - Worked with the military for a little while (mainly communications stuff)
    - His partner left at one point
        - CAMILLE CAN TELL IT WAS HIS EX HUSBAND!!!!! HOLY SHIT
        - THE LORE!!!!!!
        - His ex husband’s brother still lives in town
    - Been here for 4 years now!!
- Camille reminds Kaya that [[Reema]] (orc lady from Crossroads) is gonna be settling in soon!! She’s just back at Crossroads sorting out the last of her stuff
    - Kaya’s SO excited for this
- The gang also informs our buddies that we went through the [[Forest of Mysteries|Forbidden Forest]]
    - We tell them how to pass through
    - Camille tells Quiv - after learning that he would never sleep outside - that they can teach him how to “pitch a tent” (unknowing of the connotation)
- There’s talk about shitting pants and farting. CJ says “You can’t Prestidigitate your dignity back!”
- PERCEPTION CHECK
    - CAMILLE GETS A NAT 20
    - Ozwin is here! He was going to get a room for the night
    - The Keeper sent him

    - DURGEN PASSES TF OUT. Quiv offers to take him home and floats the dude away
- Vallen’s :( about not having drinking buddies anymore
    - THE GANG TAKES SHOTS WITH HIM. CAMILLE TOO!!
    - Cordelia takes 2 shots (she’s a lightweight 💀)
- Cordelia says Camille is really nice (compared to the rest of the party)
- We order more shots and discuss how vampires get drunk
    - When vampires ingest blood, it can be used for multiple functions (one of which can be used to get drunk)
    - ANOTHER USE IS TO GET AN ERECTION
- Also Vallen is down to drink the blood of anyone in the party so long as we’re down for it
- Kaya tries to pass Cordelia a water “shot”
    - She succeeds 🤩
- WE TALK MORE ABOUT VALLEN DRINKING OUR BLOOD
    - If he drinks the blood of someone who’s drunk, then he gets extra drunk
    - He probably shouldn’t drink any of our blood though because that’ll fuck up his ability to walk in the sun
- CORDELIA SAYS SHE’S NOT SURE IF SHE’S EVEN INTO BLONDE GUYS AND PASSES OUT
    - The gang helps carry her back to her room

# Morning Comes
- We wake up (we were too drunk to have dreams)
- Everyone (except for Camille) rolls to see if they have hangovers
    - Nobody wakes up with a hangover 😎 we stay winning!!
- Ozwin is downstairs, smoking a pipe
- Vallen is nowhere to be found
    - Not in kitchen, not in rooms
    - Camille casts ==Sending== and checks in -- lets him know that Ozwin is here, that he doesn’t have to come, but they hope he’s alive
    - Vallen’s Message Back: “I’m on my way back”

## Meeting with Ozwin
- **Reason why Ozwin’s in town**
    - The Keeper’s thought it over, and he’s decided that Ozwin should be our point of contact + he will be giving us orders from now on
    - Everyone rolls insight on this
        - Seems to be telling the truth
    - His goal is to help us find the Pyramid and point us in the right direction -- this time he’s running everything by the Keeper (unlike the last mission we went on)
        - INSIGHT REVEALS THAT HE _KNEW_ DR. POPE WAS GONNA BE THERE
- Dr. Pope is a touchy subject
    - **Dr. Pope used to be a Clover operative, before he defected to Diamond**
    - Clover wanted to have ethical inventions, and testing on people in the Capital isn’t permitted (hence why he defected to Diamond)
- Cal asks if Ozwin is implying that Dr. Pope was involved in human experimentation
    - Yeah.. Cal’s disappointed
- **OZWIN’S REQUEST**
    - He needs us to go to [[Mossley]]
    - **There are reports of a Warforged “observing” in Mossley** -- there’s suspicion of Diamond maybe using this as an entry point into Clover
    - **Our job isn’t to fight them, but to observe the battle (not to engage ourselves) and check if our connection to the shape _happens_**
    - Some of Ozwin’s people are already on their way. Once we hear back from them, then we can move out
    - Ozwin suggests that we head back to the Capital later today to get a head start
    - If we get close enough, we can kill the Warforged. But that shouldn’t be our main priority
    - Ozwin can’t come with us (there are too many things he has to set up in town)
- Where’s [[Nicholas Powers|Nick Powers]]?
    - Still off looking for Cal -- exact whereabouts unknown
    - Cordelia starts gaslighting Ozwin into believing Nicholas’s surname is “Bottom”
        - Ozwin mentions that he might let the codex and Mercenary’s Guild know about the name change
- We should use our Sending Stone to let the head honchos know that we’re on our way so they can put us on the right boat with the right crew
- Vallen comes back
    - HE SLEPT WITH FUCKING [[Investigator Teasley|TEASLEY]]. IT WAS NOT GOOD. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
    - Camille does not approve. Largely because it doesn’t seem like Vallen had a good time :( homie deserves better than drunk sex with his ex
    - We fill Vallen in on Mossley
