    - [[Camille Xotli|Camille]] goes to ~~Voss‚Äôs~~ [[Myra Delaine|Journeyman Delaine‚Äôs]] room

- Camille looks around Delaine‚Äôs room for something that clearly belongs to her
    - Investigation rolls like ASS!!!
    - There‚Äôs a little box tucked away underneath her bed (it‚Äôs built into the wall)
    - They open the box (roll for Religion. rolled a 5 and a 6 back to back)
    - **FINDS A MEDALLION FOR THE CULT OF ASMODEUS**
    - Also finds a hairtie
    - Goes to the brig, where [[Sulk|Voss]] is
- Cordelia is still following Vallen
    - Cordelia rolls a 23 on Stealth, Vallen rolls a NAT 20 on Perception
    - Vallen passes by Journeyman Delaine‚Äôs room
    - Seems like he‚Äôs going to the brig (like Camille is?)
    - He doesn‚Äôt seem to notice Cordelia‚Äôs following him (lie)
- Cal tries to shoulder-check Vallen as he leaves the kitchen and goes back to the room??
    - HE SHOULDER-CHECKS HIM
    - Vallen turns to look at him, tells him that he‚Äôs going to the brig -- He ‚Äúwants to see what happens‚Äù

# In The Brig
- Setup
    - There are 4 cells, he‚Äôs in the furthest cell
    - Voss looks PASSED OUT. Bereft of anything to kill himself with
- CAMILLE LORE HAPPENS. What‚Äôs revealed:
    - Changelings are more or less from Spade -- Voss came to Clover willingly
    - [[Changelings#The Father|The Father]]:
        - Is THOUSANDS of years old ([[Changelings]] have been with him for generations) **(NOTE: NOBODY LIVES PAST 400)**
        - Can give magic to people. The higher one is in the organization, the more magic they get
        - Is down for the war between Clover and Diamond -- because once it‚Äôs over, he can make his ‚Äúgrand entrance‚Äù
    - Changelings used to rule the continent
    - Camille reveals:
        - That they‚Äôre not actually ‚ÄúCamille‚Äù -- their real name is Qu√©n
        - That they can‚Äôt change ‚Äúback‚Äù or in the same way that other Changelings can. In response, Voss says that they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot a real Changeling, then‚Äù
    - Voss‚Äôs true name is [[Sulk]]
- Camille asks Voss what the amulet they found is -- they lie and say that they can use it to pray when Voss says that he doesn‚Äôt know what it is, and he says that they should _definitely_ use it to pray
    - REMINDER: IT‚ÄôS A SYMBOL FOR THE CULT OF ASMODEUS (IZZIE THEORY: THE FATHER IS ACTUALLY ASMODEUS)

## Discussing ‚ÄúCamille‚Äù
- Vallen asks Kaya ‚Äúshould we talk about that?‚Äù and they return to the room
    - CAL IS NAKED IN THE COMMON ROOM, HOLDING A STACK OF PAPERS. HE FOUND CORDELIA‚ÄôS FANFIC AND WAS JORKIN IT?????
    - Cal temporarily leaves to put on his clothes
- Vallen shares what he and Kaya learned:
    - The Father is in Spade, is thousands of years old, and Changelings used to rule the continent
    - The general consensus is that we should tell [[the Keeper]], but NOT the Captain (he‚Äôs already had a long-ass day)
- The gang goes back to the bar to drink again LMAO

        - Kaya says that the matter of ‚ÄúVoss‚Äù is something that they‚Äôre kinda working on
    - The Barmaid offers Kaya a drink -- she accepts
    - KAYA GETS A WHOLE BOTTLE OF WINE!! The Barmaid turns down her request to share a cup though (but maybe later? üò≥üëÄ)
- Cal tells ANYBODY that‚Äôs willing to listen his version of events (Nick Powers style)
    - According to him, he spared Voss because he was feeling kind, he threw Delaine out the window, and he ‚Äúspilled some guts‚Äù

## JULIAN ARRIVES!
- As the day progresses and the gang gets more drunk, **a familiar head of blonde hair appears**
    - At this point, Cordelia has been slowly nursing her bottle of wine (she‚Äôs literally PONDERING)
    - In other words, she doesn‚Äôt notice that Julian‚Äôs walked in
- CAL LITERALLY YELLS CORDELIA‚ÄôS NAME AND POINTS OUT JULIAN TO HER
    - **JULIAN WAS WITH HIS ENTIRE GROUP OF COWORKERS. OH MY GOD.**
    - Cal excitedly waves to Julian and points out Cordelia to him

    - Cordelia‚Äôs feelings are a little hurt, but instead of doing anything she pretends as if nothing happened

    - Vallen flips through some papers, DEEP SIGH. Says ‚Äúokay‚Äù quietly.
- Camille knocks on the door, makes themself known
    - Vallen has to return home after our trip to Mossley :( he does NOT look happy about this (in a depressed way, not in an angry way)
    - Vallen‚Äôs from [[Oakheart]]!
- Cordelia is waiting outside the bar, nursing her drink
    - What were Camille and Vallen up to? Talkin :]
    - She didn‚Äôt seem to see Julian after he left the Communications Room
    - Does she want company? She doesn‚Äôt know

    - Vallen asks what Cordelia‚Äôs up to (real talk)

    - Cordelia confesses that she‚Äôs worried about her situation AND HAVING FEELINGS FOR BOTH JULIAN _AND_ VALLEN!!!
    - Camille advises that she tell both of them that she has feelings, but doesn‚Äôt know what to do about them -- that way she and the apples of her eyes can figure things out together :]
    - Camille asks what it‚Äôs like to ‚Äúlike‚Äù someone
        - ACCORDING TO CORDELIA. LIKING SOMEONE IS WANTING TO HAVE SEX WITH THEM
        - Camille is like ‚Äúhm. interesting‚Äù

# We [[Dreams & Visions|Dream]]
- We see each other in the dream
- We‚Äôre standing outside of [[Clover Capital|the Capital]] -- we can see the Keeper‚Äôs Tower in the near distance
- Looking at each other, we‚Äôre all bloodied. Our clothes and weapons are covered in blood. Each of us look as if we‚Äôre worn out, like we‚Äôve just had a huge battle (although we don‚Äôt quite feel it)
- We see the same figure as from previous dreams, but this time he‚Äôs closer -- maybe 50 feet away
    - He‚Äôs holding what appears to be a [[Pyramid]]
- **THE CAPITAL ERUPTS IN EXPLOSIONS AND IS ON FIRE üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•**

# Morning Comes
- Camille briefly catches Vallen up on the dream
    - Cordelia also wakes up, joins the conversation
    - Vallen asks what the Curator said about our dreams -- Camille says that they might be glimpses of a possible future?
- Kaya walks into the room (she‚Äôs mad that her wonderful night was ruined by a terrible dream)
- Camille shows Cordelia, Kaya, and Vallen the necklace they found
    - They theorize that the Father is the same person as Asmodeus
    - They share that the Father is thousands of years old, and that he can share magic with people in his organization
- Cordelia flashes the letter that she wrote to Camille
    - She doesn‚Äôt know where Julian‚Äôs room is, but they can do some snooping üòà
- CAL STILL HASN‚ÄôT SHOWN UP
    - Kaya goes up to the barmaid that Cal slept with, and she says ‚Äúoh, you probably want to go get him‚Äù -- which results in Kaya receiving her room number written on a napkin
    - When she gets to the room, she sees:
        - THE ROOM IS TRASHED
        - CAL IS NAKED, CHAINED TO THE WALL WITH A BALLGAG STILL IN HIS MOUTH
    - Kaya shields her eyes and tries her best to untangle Cal (also throws a blanket on him)
    - KAYA UNHOOKS CAL‚ÄôS HANDS AND LEAVES THE REST FOR CAL TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF
    - Cal is so excited about the things that were done to him üíÄüò≠üò≠
- We have breakfast (eggs, bacon, hashbrowns)
    - Camille tries to share what happened, but finds out that Vallen and Kaya eavesdropped on their conversation with Sulk/‚ÄùVoss‚Äù
    - THE VIBES ARE OFF AS THEY CONTINUE TO TRY AND SHARE INFORMATION. They end up excusing themself to ‚Äúlook for some information‚Äù as Vallen tries to apologize and excuse himself/Kaya for listening in
- Camille finds where Julian sleeps (in the barracks, where he shares a room with a bunch of other guys)
    - They report back to Cordelia, and ask if she wants help delivering the letter. She says she‚Äôd rather do it on her own
- Izzie note: Camille feels like SHIT ü§©ü§©ü§©
- The gang gets ready to leave/arrive in [[Mossley]]!

# We Prepare to Arrive in Mossley
- We go to the deck -- we‚Äôre surrounded by people running around doing their jobs
    - CAL IS SURPRISED THAT WE‚ÄôRE ON A BOAT
- The Captain comes up to us
    - We‚Äôre about an hour from landfall in Mossley
    - After we cross the bridge, it‚Äôll be silence on board (we don‚Äôt know if Mossley‚Äôs been taken over or not, so it‚Äôs better safe than sorry)
    - We‚Äôre reminded of our responsibilities (find the commander Warforged and observe them)
- CAL AND VALLEN DO THE TITANIC THING (CAL STANDING AT THE FRONT OF THE SHIP WITH VALLEN HOLDING HIS WAIST)
- Cordelia looks for Julian -- he seems to be on the edge of the ship, near the rails, moving some crates
    - She approaches him, with seconds to spare as we cross under the bridge

## Camille Re-Interrogates ‚ÄúVoss‚Äù/Sulk
- Camille casts ==Zone of Truth==
- Where‚Äôs the book? [[Sulk]] says he doesn‚Äôt know
    - HE‚ÄôS LYINGGG
    - WE LEARN THAT [[CHANGELINGS|CHANGELINGS]] AREN‚ÄôT ACTUALLY AFFECTED BY ==ZONE OF TRUTH==?????
- He says he will tell Camille where the book is if they accept his offer
    - Camille asks what he plans to do if they accept. (Kill everyone)
        - Hearing this, the guards subtly tighten their grips on their weapons
        - They say they would rather not kill anyone
- Camille asks the guards - who are in the range of ==Zone of Truth== what the plans are with Sulk
    - Bring him back to the Capital (where he will probably be killed)
    - Sulk plans to do whatever his captors want him to do
- Camille apologizes to Sulk and then leaves

## Quiet Hours
- Cordelia hands Julian the letter RIGHT as quiet hours hit -- then she runs away to wherever his line of sight _isn‚Äôt_
- Camille pointedly avoids the party for the next few hours

# Landfall in [[Mossley]]
- There are _no_ civilians in Mossley whatsoever. Houses appear to be untouched -- it‚Äôs like a ghost town
    - After 10 minutes, people begin to disembark and make camp. Quiet time is now over.
- Group Perception
    - We see there‚Äôs a little path that goes up through the mountains and has a great viewpoint of the entire battlefield
- [[Finnigan Seamus|the Captain]] remains on the ship while camp is being set up, and comes to talk to us
    - There are no civilians to protect, so the plan is to focus wholeheartedly on the Warforged and push them back through the mountainpass
    - He will send troops to Troutndale and Hage, likely in two groups of five
    - He‚Äôs not a general, but he thinks that the mountain overlook area is the best place for us to be stationed
- As we end our conversation with the Captain, we hear marching
    - We should hurry!!

# Overlooking the Battle
- As we head up to the overlook point, we see THOUSANDS of [[Warforged]]. They outnumber us by a _lot_.
    - Camille suggests that we immediately contact the Captain, and looks to the mountains -- can we collapse them and prevent the army from passing through?
- Two Warforged come out to talk with Clover dignitaries to try and negotiate
    - After they separate, nothing happens for a few minutes
    - The [[Cover military]] walks a little closer to the Warforged. THEN AN ALL-OUT FIGHT BREAKS OUT
- As we watch this, we see that **the Warforged aren‚Äôt really fighting back**
    - The Warforged are just moving in an outwards hexagonal pattern
    - None of the Clover army has fallen
- We _don‚Äôt_ see a commanding Warforged
    - Camille and Cal agree that the Warforged are probably communicating in a way that isn‚Äôt immediate (magical? electric?)
- PERCEPTION
    - We hear a metallic-sounding voice come from behind us: ‚ÄúInteresting war, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù
    - We turn and see [[OSIRIS|this]] behind us: ![[OSIRIS.jpg|300]]
-  Camille and this person briefly converse:
    - C: It‚Äôs interesting because your people aren‚Äôt fighting back. Why?
    - ??: We always have room to learn.
    - C: And you learn by dying?
    - ??: We can always make more.
    - Cordelia asks who it is
        - It was made by [[Caduceus Pope|Dr. Pope]]
        - Its name is [[OSIRIS|Oracle Sentinel of Insight, Restoration, and Intelligent Strategy (OSIRIS)]]
    - OSIRUS states that our purpose is to observe and kill. Camille counters and says that _our_ purpose is to observe, but the army‚Äôs purpose is to keep the Warforged army from entering the Kingdom
- We engage in a philosophical debate with OSIRIS
    - It asks why we pick up weapons willingly, when Warforged are born with them (we all have our own reasons. Camille does it to protect the people they love, for Cal it‚Äôs necessary)
    - The Warforged Army is going to push forward to the Capital if the Clover army stops fighting -- they do this because this is what Diamond ordered them to do
    - Are Warforged alive??
- Cordelia casts ==Detect Magic==
    - She sees - in the center of his chest - a very _bright_ source of magic. It seems almost celestial in nature, but almost like every school of magic that an organic person would have throughout their body (although for OSIRIS, it‚Äôs centered in its chest and doesn‚Äôt hold it together)
- OSIRIS asks what it means to be a Clover citizen
    - Cal says he‚Äôs a citizen of the world, and that he fights to protect people -- ALL people, not just organic life
    - OSIRIS asks if being a Clover Citizen means fighting to protect all people
        - Camille responds and says that we‚Äôre not exactly normal Clover Citizens, and that we‚Äôre not the right people to ask. _But_ we‚Äôre willing to answer its questions. Not many people are.
- OSIRIS asks if it were Diamond soldiers fighting instead of Warforged, would we feel any better?
    - No
- OSIRIS asks if it‚Äôs in an Organic‚Äôs nature to fight
    - Camille responds and says that it‚Äôs in an Organic‚Äôs nature to _survive_, but survival means different things to different people
- OSIRIS makes a point about how Clover attacks Diamond
- Camille asks OSIRIS if it will be remade if it dies
    - It doesn‚Äôt know -- Cal assumes that Dr. Pope will simply make another one if this one dies
- Camille asks if OSIRIS will come with us willingly if we ask/don‚Äôt fight
    - No
    - Camille says that it‚Äôs a shame, because they like it (OSIRIS SAYS IT LIKES THEM TOO???)
- WE ROLL FOR INITIATIVE

## INITIATIVE

- Vallen (23)
- Cal (23)
