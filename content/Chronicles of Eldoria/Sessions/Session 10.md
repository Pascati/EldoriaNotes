# Post-Combat
- As the ashes of Dagen drift to the floor, his soul darts through the ceiling

- [[Caduceus Pope|Dr. Pope]] turns to the party and says he‚Äôs going back to Diamond to ‚Äúprepare the armies‚Äù
    - Vallen turns to Cal and says that we should take him with us, regardless of whether or not he wants to come with us
    - Cal just fuckin CLOCKS him and he goes unconscious as fuck
- Camille throws some rope down to tie Dr. Pope up
    - They run upstairs, Cordelia runs behind them
    - Cal and Vallen stay behind to tie up Dr. Pope
- Kaya‚Äôs SO worried about being a vampire
    - IS SHE A VAMPIRE???? SHE‚ÄôS ASKING VALLEN
    - It‚Äôs ok she‚Äôs chill everything‚Äôs fine and good she‚Äôs not a vampire -- he didn‚Äôt infect her

## Upstairs
- Camille and Cordelia make their way upstairs -- they see **piles of ash on the ground** on the stairs leading up to the party
    - The guard that we knocked out earlier is no longer there
    - The door leading out of the stairs is GONE!! just a fuckin hole
- We see few guests helping each other up, it looks like the vampires and warforged LEFT THE FUCKING BUILDING
- Everyone else joins the party -- Camille says we should go upstairs
    - Vallen suggests that we just burn the building down
    - THE GANG STARTS FIGHTING ABT WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD OR SHOULDN‚ÄôT BURN THE PLACE DOWN
    - Cordelia and Vallen are BEEFING!! HE TELLS HER TO FIND HER BOYFRIEND!!! GOD DAMN
- Camille runs upstairs while the gang is arguing -- Cordelia gives Vallen a STERN fuckin look and follows after
    - There‚Äôs NOBODY upstairs

    - There are some doors open upstairs, leading to guest bedrooms
    - There‚Äôs a big double door at the end of the hallway, which looks like the master bedroom
- Cordelia casts ==Prestidigitation== on Kaya to get the blood off her

# We Finally Kill Dagen
- Camille opens the door to the master bedroom
    - It‚Äôs a bigass room!! lots of room for ‚Äúactivities‚Äù (this is a reference that I don‚Äôt get)
    - Vallen farts (IT‚ÄôS CANON. CORDELIA GIVES HIM THE CRAZIEST SIDE-EYE)
    - There‚Äôs a MASSIVE bed in there
    - Nobody in there
- Everyone looks around!!
    - Cal rolls a NAT 20 TO INVESTIGATE!!! Kaya also rolls to investigate
        - It looks like people left in a hurry
        - Scattered around the room, they find **50 GP**
    - Camille rolls a 22 on insight to determine where a vampire might keep their shit
        - Realizes that there‚Äôs something odd with the bed
        - At the same time, Cal realizes that the bed can be _moved_ (thank u nat 20)
- We move the bed!! Behind it is a door
    - We open the door üòé
    - The room behind it is very similar to the one we‚Äôre currently in, and it **contains two CLOSED coffins**
- The gang asks Vallen to stab the fuck outta one of the coffins
    - Cal and Vallen stab both coffins at the same time!!
    - There‚Äôs the sound of crunching bones inside the coffin that Cal stabs
    - The one Vallen strikes is _silent_
- Cal retracts his spear and opens up the coffin he stabbed: **he sees a half-regenerated Dagen**
    - It looks like a corpse that just melted into the coffin -- there‚Äôs lots of meat, ligaments, and fucked up bits. He‚Äôs missing one eye and the other is missing its eyelid
    - His one good eye slides over to look at Cal, but Dagen doesn‚Äôt appear to be able to move
    - CAL SHOVES AN ACTIVATED SUN STONE INTO Dagen‚ÄôS EMPTY EYE SOCKET AND KILLS THE FUCK OUTTA HIM!!!
- Dagen‚Äôs half-regenerated corpse withers and dusts away
- The gang debates whether or not we should look for Dagen‚Äôs wife
    - If he turned her, then she will wither away eventually (same thing with all the vampires he turned) within the next few days or a week or two
    - We decide not to worry about her rn
- Camille suggests that we search the rest of the mansion/castle in the meantime for additional information, especially if there‚Äôs further plans, connections to other vampire groups, or the [[Changelings]]
- Camille tries to barehanded grab Dagen‚Äôs ashes
    - Cordelia is like ‚Äúwtf no‚Äù and puts Dagen‚Äôs ashes in a little vial (she keeps it!)

# The Aftermath

- The gang decides to go back to the basement to collect what information we can (schematics, shadow boxes, etc.etc.)
- Camille is STRUGGLING to pronounce hors d'oeuvres (they wanna grab some on the way back down to the scary basement)
- We need to report back to [[Clover Capital|the Capital]] -- Vallen hands Camille a sending stone to let the Keeper know that we‚Äôre done
    - **Message to [[The Keeper]]:** Good news: Dagen's dead. Bad news: Diamond has LOTS of machine-like soldiers ready to attack, but we have the scientist who made them. Capital soon.
    - **Response message:** We‚Äôve received news, come to the capital IMMEDIATELY. Bring the scientist and Vallen.
- We debate on how to get to the Capital
    - [[NorthPass]] has ferries!! so we can be back in the Capital pretty soon
- The party splits up: Vallen goes to prepare the carriage (gets the pink slip from Camille), Camille and Cordelia run to the basement to gather stuff, and Kaya and Cal start looting
    - Cordelia and Camille
        - We grab the schematics!! There‚Äôs not a ton of stuff that Camille understands in there
        - When Camille grabs the paper for the pyramid, they VERY QUICKLY hear the distant screams of bloody murder and feel an absolute sense of dread
        - Cordelia supervises Camille shoving shit into their pockets
        - We get **five shadow boxes**
    - Kaya and Cal
        - Kaya steals a nice blanket (it‚Äôs like a bajillion thread count) (she‚Äôs also wearing it like a cape)
- As we leave the building, the town is _dead_ -- nobody‚Äôs out and about

    - CAL SET THE DAMN BUILDING ON FIRE!!!

# Traveling Back to the Capital
- CARRIAGE ARRANGEMENTS
    - Vallen and Camille sit up at the front of the carriage
    - Everyone else is SNOOZING
    - Dr. Pope is on the floor
- As we‚Äôre leaving, Vallen asks Camille why they called out to Lathander earlier
    - He hates the undead, we were fighting vampires, and Lathander _could_ be their god (since they still don‚Äôt know who blessed them), so it was worth a shot
    - Camille asks if Vallen worships Lathander despite his hate of the undead -- he does! Because his dad worshipped Lathander ü•∫
    - Camille asks what Vallen‚Äôs dad was like: he was an incredible man, took great care of himself and his mother
    - Camille reminisces and says that their brother was much the same -- he took good care of them when they were younger
    - When Vallen asks Camille what their brother‚Äôs name was, they say that they‚Äôre not ready to say it yet
    - Camille falls asleep on Vallen‚Äôs shoulder and drools all over him

## WE GET ATTACKED
- As we're asleep, Vallen wakes Camille up and lets them know that he thinks we‚Äôre being followed
    - An unmarked carriage pulls up and slams into us!!!
    - THERE‚ÄôS A GUY ON THE ROOF!! ANOTHER ONE SKITTERS AROUND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CARRIAGE AND TRIES TO OPEN THE WINDOW
    - **Enemies so far: Roof Guy and The Skitterer**
- The Skitterer pulls the window down, grabs Dr. Pope, and begins trying to pull him out
    - KAYA KICKS HIM
    - CORDELIA CASTS ==HOLD PERSON== ON DR. POPE SO HE CAN‚ÄôT TRY TO ESCAPE (he‚Äôs still unconscious so the spell automatically succeeds)
- Camille casts ==Spirit Guardians== so that all enemies within a 15 ft. radius of them take damage (immediately take **19 points of radiant**)
- Cordelia has to make a **DEX save** as a dagger DIGS into her arm (ROOF GUY STABBED HER)
    - Concentration Check: successful! But she has a knife sticking out of her arm :(
    - Roof Guy tries to push Dr. Pope out of the carriage

- Kaya casts ==Mold Earth== to try and trip up the wheels of the carriage following us
    - BIGASS CHICAGO-STYLE POTHOLE!!
    - It pops up right behind the horses but in front of the wheels. THE CARRIAGE FLIPS THE FUCK OVER!!!

- [[Mysterious Vampire|SOME BITCH]] CASTS TIME STOP
    - THE CARRIAGE IS FROZEN IN PLACE
    - THEY TAKE DR. POPE WITH THEM! THE ==HOLD PERSON== SHATTERS!!!
    - THIS IS SO FUCKED UP AND EVIL
    - **MIGHT BE DAGEN‚ÄôS WIFE :((**
	    - Future Izzie Note: after reviewing the notes, I have reason to believe the [[Mysterious Vampire]] might be Balthazar's "dead" pupil üëÄ
    - **SHE CASTS ==TIME STOP== MULTIPLE TIMES! WE‚ÄôRE STUCK FOR _SEVERAL MINUTES_**
- As ==Time Stop== wears off, Vallen pulls the carriage to a stop
    - Cordelia recaps to the gang what happened and passes out as she realizes there‚Äôs a knife in her arm
    - Camille casts ==Cure Wounds== on Cordelia for 12 HP
- Vallen suggests that we just kill the guy after we question him. Camille reasons that we might as well let the Keeper decide what to do with him, since we don‚Äôt have Pope anymore
    - Camille breathes a sigh of relief when Vallen agrees
- Camille casts ==Zone of Truth== -- The Skitterer fails
    - What‚Äôs your name? [[Garrett]]
    - Does he work for the person who kidnapped Dr. Pope? Yes
    - Does he know who the person is? No, but **_she_ is from Diamond**
    - Does he know what they want with Dr. Pope? **He‚Äôs the only one who can stop the [[warforged]]**
    - Where is she taking Dr. Pope? Back to his lab in Diamond
    - Where in Diamond is the lab? In the north (the north part of Diamond)
- Camille asks Garrett if he has a family and if he wants to go back to them: yes and yes
    - If he wants to survive, they suggest that he give us more information
    - Where in the north is the lab? In a town called **[[Iron Forge]]**, but he doesn‚Äôt know exactly where in the town it is
    - Does he want war? Yes
    - How come? Clover deserves the war
    - How come? They‚Äôre evil people
- Camille tells Garrett what Dr. Pope‚Äôs plan was: to kill everyone and let vampires (not Garrett) rule the world
    - Garrett seems more willing to work with us -- but **if he gets too far from his boss, a spell will kill him**
- Garrett:
    - Doesn‚Äôt think that the lady is [[Dagen's Wife]]
    - Was a part of the Solaris platoon of [[Diamond Military]], and specializes in special ops
- Garrett‚Äôs skin starts to pale and his cheeks sink -- he‚Äôs dying
    - Camille cuts his bonds and tells him to go. They don‚Äôt want any more people to die tonight
    - Garrett throws a sending stone on the ground, tells us ‚ÄúI was never here‚Äù, and sprints into the night
    - Camille picks up the sending stone
- We get back on the road
    - Cal gives Camille Lathander‚Äôs necklace that we got from the dungeon
    - Cal looks at the schematics:
        - Flying machines to block out the sun
        - **I MISSED THE SECOND PART I‚ÄôM SORRY**
- Kaya reaches over to touch the drawing of the upside-down triangle (The Pyramid)
    - She hears much the same of what Camille heard and feels what they felt when they first touched it

# Pulling up to [[NorthPass]]
- Blonde elven lady approaches Vallen AND PUTS A HAND ON HIS LEG?? and greets him like an old friend
    - This is the mother of the child we saved!! Her name is Elizabeth
    - Her husband is currently gone (he left this morning to the Capital)
    - There‚Äôs still a ferry left bound for the Capital!! It leaves in 15 mins
- Camille hands Elizabeth 10 GP and goes to load the cart on the Ferry while Vallen makes travel arrangements for us
- Apparently the ferry‚Äôs filling up FAST!! Lots of people from the party are there **(Cordelia audible gulp sound)**
- Who‚Äôs been on a boat before?
    - Cordelia and Cal ‚úîÔ∏è

        - Cordelia rn: ![[bruh.png|180]]
    - CORDELIA GOES RIGHT TOWARDS [[Julian|JULIAN]]!!!
- The gang pulls up (looking for Cordelia) AND SEES HER WITH HIM
- Cordelia pulls up next to Julian robotically as hell (but she‚Äôs trying to make it seem casual and like she‚Äôs just looking out over the horizon)
    - Julian looks around and looks in her direction
    - Julian: Are you also looking for someone?
    - Cordelia: \*wringing her hands\* I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ know‚Ä¶
    - Julian: You don‚Äôt know? Well, we‚Äôre all looking for something. You heading to the Capital, then?
    - Cordelia: Yeah. I feel like I always end up back there.
    - Julian: Always. But, I have a duty to do. What are you going to [[Clover Capital|the Capital]] for?
    - Cordelia: I‚Ä¶ run a _flower_ shop.
        - DECEPTION CRIT FAIL!! JULIAN ROLLS A 19. YOU CAN‚ÄôT MAKE THIS SHIT UP!!!!!
    - Julian: Flower shops‚Ä¶ How long have you run flower shops in the Capital? Also, where‚Äôs it at? I would love to come by and buy flowers
    - Cordelia: üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è ‚Ä¶. oh no‚Ä¶..
    - Cordelia: You know‚Ä¶. A couple of years? _So what about you? What are you going back for?_
    - Julian: I‚Äôm going back to do my duty. My father‚Äôs very adamant I get my rank up
    - Cordelia: So what rank are you right now?
    - Julian: I‚Äôm a, uh, I‚Äôm a Journeyman, but my father‚Äôs a Captain. I‚Äôm trying to get to Sentinel before the end of the year, start of the new.
    - Cordelia: That‚Äôs impressive. You must have a‚Ä¶ wife???
    - Julian: No, no wife. I am engaged though. Though I _am_ questioning it, that isn‚Äôt something a stranger should know.
    - Cordelia: I suppose not. You know, I‚Äôve been there.
    - Julian: Arranged marriages, am I right?
    - C: For the longest time, I just lived with the idea that it was never something for me. I had my books - _my flowers_. And that was enough. That was always enough. And this news gets dropped on you, and‚Ä¶
    - J: I know! And she‚Äôs already running away
    - C: She ran?
    - J: She ran. Her father is looking for her, obviously, but last anyone knows she left the Capital. She could be in Diamond, for all I know
    - C: Could be. Why do you think she ran?
    - J: Oh, I would. I would, for sure. Capital isn‚Äôt meant for people like‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not meant for everybody. It‚Äôs not meant for me, that‚Äôs for sure. If I could leave, I would.
    - C: What would you do?
    - J: I don‚Äôt know. I would like a little house in the mountains.
    - C: Yeah‚Ä¶
    - J: But, where‚Äôs your, uh, ‚Äúflower‚Äù shop at? I‚Äôll come visit.
    - C: Uh‚Ä¶
    - J: Best of luck. \*Turns around and begins to walk away\*
- The gang approaches Cordelia to console her
    - Vallen is leaned back on the railing, looking directly at Cordelia
    - **IT‚ÄôS GIVING ‚ÄúVALLEN DISAPPROVES‚Äù**
- Camille checks the vibes (Insight 23)
    - Cordelia is deciding between choices. Vallen is observing the situation (IN A NEUTRAL WAY)
    - As Cordelia meets Vallen‚Äôs eyes, he gives her a nod and turns around

# Arriving in [[Clover Capital|The Capital]]
- Since Julian is there, there are probably other Guardians from the military
    - Cordelia realizes that they‚Äôre probably looking for her üòü
- Camille pulls Vallen to the side
    - They‚Äôre worried about [[Poppy Xotli|their mother]] -- she lives on the border of Diamond and Clover, and if war breaks out, she will be among the first to be affected
    - Would [[The Keeper]] be ok with Camille housing their mother? For a pay cut maybe?
        - Vallen says that the Keeper would probably be willing to do it for free, but Camille should ask after the Council disbands
    - Camille asks Vallen to make sure their mom (‚ÄúA woman that looks like me‚Äù) doesn‚Äôt die if he ever comes across her. Vallen‚Äôs leaving the group after this, but he doesn‚Äôt seem against the idea
    - At the mention of Vallen leaving the party, they say that they really value their time with him and that he was one of the first real friends they‚Äôve ever made. They express that they hope their (as in Camille and Vallen‚Äôs) paths cross again
    - As they leave to unload the carriage, Vallen calls out Camille‚Äôs name. In response, they very quietly go ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my name‚Äù. Vallen says he will keep that in mind
- Group Perception
    - As soon as the ship docks, we all see that the town is in a PANIC!! The military in the capital is on ALERT
    - One of the guards steps out, asking for the entire party BY NAME!!
        - JULIAN HEARS CORDELIA‚ÄôS NAME AND üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è STARTS LOOKING AROUND
        - Vallen raises his hand and points us out to the guards
        - The guards say that the Keeper‚Äôs ordered us to go to the Garrison, and they‚Äôre here to escort us
- The town is BUSTLING!!
    - We aren‚Äôt stopped at any check points AT. ALL!!

## The Garrison
- Large, imposing stone building, decorated in Clover‚Äôs symbols
- The guards lead us up the stairs _PAST_ [[Captain Purah|Captain Purah‚Äôs]] office, towards a **_MAGIC ELEVATOR!!!!_**
    - **From the outside looking in, we‚Äôre entering the Keeper‚Äôs Tower: the tallest building in the capital**
- The guards leave us at the door, and we walk into the top floor of the Keeper‚Äôs Tower!!
- **The Keeper‚Äôs Office:**
    - An entire half side of the room is covered in glass, giving the Keeper a south/east side view of the Capital/Kingdom
    - On the right side of the room, there‚Äôs a huge wooden desk with a massive chair + couches and chairs reminiscent of the Oval Office
    - On the left side (where the windows are _not_) of the room is a very long war table
- Who‚Äôs in the room:
    - Captain Purah (talking to some folks near the Keeper‚Äôs desk)
    - [[Ozwin|A fancy gentleman]] (dressed like what you would normally see at a fancy party) **_(OMG HIIIIIII I LOVE MEN) (HIS NAME IS OZ)_**
![[Ozwin.jpg|240]]
- Captain Purah waves us over, asks us to sit
    - She says she will need our expertise on upcoming matters
    - The Keeper is down in [[Ozwin|Oz‚Äôs]] office
    - Camille shakes Oz‚Äôs hand, learns that:

        - He‚Äôs the one who ordered our outfits for the masquerade!!
- Oz asks where Dr. Pope is -- Camille lets them know that we were attacked and that someone from Diamond cast ==Time Stop==
- Cordelia asks if we‚Äôre going to war: Oz responds affirmatively
    - She also asks for her father: he‚Äôs in the Capital for sure, likely in the Tower somewhere a few floors down

- Kaya asks if her father - [[Genlan Avarice]] - will be at the meeting
    - Oz asks if he‚Äôs a Legionary or Captain (he‚Äôs a Captain)
    - **KAYA‚ÄôS DAD WILL ALSO BE THERE**
- The [[Fire Faction leader|Fire Faction leader]] will also be at the meeting!
- **CORDELIA IS CRASHING OUT. HER DAD WILL BE THERE!! HE‚ÄôS GONNA BE SO MAD!!!**

# Meeting with the Keeper
- The Keeper walks in -- we stand up to greet him
    - He says we‚Äôre in a bit of a hurry so we will have to skip pleasantries
    - **HE HAS AN ENTOURAGE AND _BOTH CORDELIA AND KAYA‚ÄôS FATHERS ARE THERE_**
        - [[Genlan Avarice|Kaya‚Äôs dad]]: [[Water Faction]] Leader
        - [[Arthur Elysian|Cordelia‚Äôs dad]]: [[Earth Faction]] Leader
        - [[Fire Faction leader]]: [[Fire Faction]] Leader
- We all sit down
    - Vallen on the Keeper‚Äôs right-hand side, Purah next to him, and Oz on his left-hand side
    - The Keeper asks us ‚Äúwhat the hell happened‚Äù
        - Kaya informs him that we were supposed to go to Dagen‚Äôs party and investigate/get rid of him
        - **THE KEEPER DIDN‚ÄôT KNOW ABOUT THIS?!?!? OZ SIGNED OFF ON IT BUT DIDN‚ÄôT TELL HIM**
    - Camille hands over all the schematics to the Keeper
        - The Keeper now knows about Diamond‚Äôs plans to attack, and about the warforged
        - He opens up a secret passage in a bookcase, and **PULLS OUT THE ORB????**
            - We feel at peace, seeing the orb
- Perception check as the [[Orb]] is pulled out
    - **The Keeper‚Äôs holding the Orb with his _bare hands_**
    - He also grabbed the paper with the drawing of the Pyramid on it
- WE RECAP WITH THE KEEPER
    - The Curator (The Keeper has no record of the Curator in any of his archives)
        - The Curator can sense when we‚Äôre close to the Pyramid or close to someone who‚Äôs touched the Pyramid recently
    - Dr. Pope
        - He was tasked with researching alternative methods to win the war
        - Cal‚Äôs come across him a couple of times
        - The Keeper reads Cal‚Äôs mind and learns that he gave Dr. Pope the Pyramid (not that he knew what it was at the time)
- The Keeper asks: whose trust lies with Clover, and whose lies with Diamond?
    - Kaya: ‚ÄúIf no one there is there to experience peace, then there is no peace at all. I‚Äôm with Clover.‚Äù
    - Cordelia: Dead silent, staring off into the distance. At this moment, she locks eyes with her dad. ‚ÄúI have, and always will stand with Clover‚Äù
    - Camille: They‚Äôre allied with Clover because that‚Äôs where their family lives, but they question whether or not Clover has been taking Diamond‚Äôs resources like Garrett claimed
        - Diamond has a lot of resources compared to Clover, despite Clover‚Äôs size. Diamond holds a lot of agricultural resources that Clover needs to continue
        - Yes Clover _has_ been taking Diamond‚Äôs resources, but Clover and Diamond were once in an alliance. Diamond broke that alliance, so Clover stopped providing them with protections, and that‚Äôs how we got here today.
    - Cal: ‚ÄúSounds like propaganda to me. Whoever side you chooses, the other side will always pay the price. I don‚Äôt stand with Clover -- I don‚Äôt stand with _anyone_. But I stand against Diamond‚Äù
        - This is the answer the Keeper was looking for -- sacrifices must be made in order to keep this kingdom where it needs to be.
- The Keeper doesn‚Äôt understand why the Orb chose us, but he doesn‚Äôt think that it was coincidence that we all walked into Hillford‚Äôs bar at the same time, or that it was a coincidence that Cal headed to Hillford when he needed to go in the opposite direction
- **We need to be inducted (into the government??).** We‚Äôll get passes, special privileges, etc.etc.
    - **We will officially be Ambassadors of Clover**
    - **_Clover needs the Pyramid_. If Clover has the Pyramid, then Diamond will not.**
    - **We need to retrieve the Pyramid and deliver it to the Keeper**
- Camille asks the Keeper if he can keep their mother safe. The answer is yes
    - Border towns will be evacuated, others will be heavily guarded
    - Camille‚Äôs mother will be brought to the Capital
- The Keeper needs to discuss the kingdom‚Äôs next steps with the Faction Leaders and Vallen
    - Detailed reports on what‚Äôs happening in the Kingdom
    - Locking down valuable resources ([[Mithril]], Adamantium, etc.)
- The Keeper will meet us downstairs, and we will stay in the Capital for a day (we have rooms somewhere in the Tower)
- Kaya asks for updates on the [[warforged]]
    - Only received reports of 5 warforged running around
    - They could be used as scouts?
    - ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know a damn thing‚Äù. But we will be informed if the Keeper learns anything else
- As we leave, the Keeper says ‚ÄúVallen, we need to talk‚Äù _THEN THE DOORS CLOSE_
