	- Foo asks her where she's going for the day
		- She considers going to the library, but she decides against it and instead goes to join Camille at the mine
- Cordelia jogs up to Camille to join them
	- There's a little small talk -- they agree that it's not a good idea that we keep leaving Vallen to do our work üíÄ
	- Camille suggests that the party split our time at the mine into shifts, so we can each keep him company while we guard the mine

	- He smells the egg salad Camille ordered in the fucking AIR
		- He asks Foo how he makes food so quickly -- Foo says it's magic
	- He asks for a BLT with a "special tomato"??? (to test how good Foo's Food Magic is ig üíÄ)
		- A solid 60 seconds pass and Foo HAS it
		- Cal RUNS to the kitchen to try and see how Foo's Food Magic works (he thinks it's the door, like some kind of dog)
- Foo informs Kaya and Cal that Camille and Cordelia already left for the mines
	- They leave to join the rest of the gang!! (they don't see the other two yet)
	- CAL TRIES TO RACE KAYA?? HE DROPS HIS SANDWICH IN THE PROCESS

		- Cal throws a fit at losing, Camille gives him their sandwich as a condolence prize
	- Camille pitches the "we each take shifts keeping Vallen company at the mine" idea
		- Camille is going first, Cordelia going second, and Cal and Kaya can quartz, parchment, shears to see who goes third and fourth
		- Cal will go third, Kaya will go fourth

# Arriving at the Mine
- We hear some kind of mechanical revving? in the direction of the mine???
	- Camille and Kaya starts running towards the sound
- Space seems to distort in a wave as we get closer?
	- GROUP STEALTH
	- We see Vallen (near the mine, around where the cart was) -- no-one else is there. The sound is coming from him?
	- He seems to be practicing throwing this wave
		- HE'S NOT! DRENCHED IN SWEAT ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì
		- He looks exhausted and like he's been doing this a while
- Camille approaches Vallen and gives him "breakfast" (slab of raw meat)
	- He's like why is everyone here???
	- We're here to do our fucking job!! (and to take shifts and take turns keeping Vallen company)
- We learn that the Garrison is sending more people over to watch the mine tmrw, so we won't have to do our job anymore (as if we were doing it at all üíÄ)
	- Vallen says that he talked to [[Investigator Teasley]] last night and came to that conclusion
		- Camille and Kaya admit to eavesdropping on him
		- He's chill with it, but admits to eavesdropping on everyone else's conversations
			- CAMILLE'S LIKE?? AND HE'S LIKE "DON'T DIG UP THE PAST". THEY CONNECT THE DOTS AND REALIZE THAT HE WAS FOLLOWING THEM TO [[Lycoris]]
- Kaya asks Vallen about our next mission
	- He hasn't heard anything about it :(
	- CJ ASKS FOR EVERYONE'S PASSIVE INSIGHT
		- Everyone that has a passive insight of 14+ knows he's lying
	- **We're going to be sent back into Diamond**
		- Vallen says that we almost died last time!!
		- Cordelia and Camille say that he can't keep us safe by keeping us from doing things -- Cordelia wants to learn more about her [[tarot cards|cards]] and the book, and Camille says that they'll be ok because Vallen will be there to keep us safe üòäüå∏üíï
		- Vallen concedes, and says that we're going to be expected at the [[Clover Capital]] tonight
- SHENANIGANS ENSUE üëé
	- Note: Camille makes a note to learn what a "twink" is later
	- Camille asks what "come in men" means
		- Vallen is deeply upset by this
		- Cordelia says that she'll leave them a book about it tn
	- Note: Lily wanted me to say that Vallen has a dick bulge :(
- Camille hands Vallen a note (the note that "twink" is written on)

# Arriving back at [[Foo Bar|the bar]]
- We arrive back at the bar!
	- It's been about an hour and a half since we all left
- Camille asks Vallen to speak in private
	- They ask him if he knows if anyone from [[Lycoris]] was able to be evacuated in time
	- The answer is yes!!
	- They ask him to help them find the people who were able to escape -- he says he will once they give him a list, and he'll consider it a personal favor
	- They get teary-eyed and give him a hug

# Arriving in the [[Clover Capital|Capital]]
- We walk out of the closet in the Garrison (we get a few weird looks)
	- Camille waves to people üëãüòä
	- When they see Vallen, they look away
- [[Simon]] (at the front desk) allows us upstairs, and we walk past [[Captain Purah]]'s office
	- The door is open, but she's not in there
- We reach the elevator -- there seems to be a line to enter it??
	- WE GET THE FAST PASS!! THE GUARDS LET US THROUGH BCS THEY KNOW VALLEN
- At the top floor, [[The Keeper]]'s doors are closed, but there are still a bunch of people waiting to speak with him
	- [[Ozwin]] and [[Captain Purah]] are arguing in front of the door
		- At some point [[Captain Purah]] walks away frustrated, and as she does, [[Ozwin]] calls out to her loud enough for everyone to hear: "When the mithril mines dry up, do not come back to me."
		- According to [[Ozwin]], [[Captain Purah]] wants to divert troops from the mithril mines to shore up Clover's borders
	- [[Ozwin]] says that [[Caduceus Pope|Dr. Pope]] has gone missing, and that some agents sent to Diamond to keep track of him have gone missing as well. His last known location was [[Iron forge]]
	- Camille commiserates with [[Ozwin]], and casts ==Guidance== on him
		- He thanks them and says that if there's anything we need, we can just ask him
- Ozwin says that the Keeper should be ready for us
	- We can skip the line!! (filled with politicians and people wearing faction colors)
	- Also has some choice words to say about how the Keeper organizes things (mans is stressed as hell)

## Speaking to the Keeper
- There are two people - one wearing a red robe (Fire Faction) and one wearing a purple robe (palace colors) -  yelling in front of the Keeper's desk
- The Keeper greets us, asks us why we're here
	- Camille addresses him by name ([[The Keeper|V]]), and he's like üòä omg u remembered!
	- They ask if "V" is his full name -- it's not, his full name is ***Vyapada***
		- It was given to him, but not by his parents. He didn't know his parents.
- [[The Keeper]] says that **our next mission is to go to [[Iron forge]]**
	- The Keeper asks if we saw anyone from Diamond -- we did, there were lots of higher-up Diamond officials in [[South Haran]] (there were *some* lower-ranking officials, but there were mostly higher-ups)
		- He asks us why there were so many higher-up members. He suspects that the ***Diamond military is VERY QUICKLY losing control of its warforged army***
		- There has not been a **single Diamond insignia on the [[warforged]]**
- The Keeper still hasn't confirmed the location of the [[Pyramid]] -- he's asking us to *confirm its location*
	- He sent a group of rogues to check on it in [[Iron forge]], but he hasn't heard back from them
- The Keeper mentions that WE mentioned that there was a "benefactor" who actually HAD the Pyramid in Diamond
	- I forgor abt that tbh
- Camille asks when we need to leave
	- The Keeper says as soon as possible
	- ***HE WANTS US TO BRING THE [[Pyramid]] BACK TO HIM***
- Camille requests a few things:
	- A vessel to carry the [[Pyramid]], and gloves to touch it with
	- A method for us to disguise ourselves (more than just clothes)
	- The Keeper agrees to these requests, and says that:
		- Cordelia will receive books for ==Disguise Self== and ==Pass Without Trace==
		- We can request other things from the quartermaster, but we should keep our requests within reason
- The Keeper mentions that Cordelia saw something leave [[OSIRIS|OSIRIS's]] body, and asks how she can see souls
	- She's like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
	- The Keeper's like "Tarot users boggle my mind" and she's like I HAVE QUESTIONS
- The rest of the party begins to leave, but Cordelia stays behind to discuss some things
- The Keeper asks her if she knows the name [[Balthazar]]
	- *"An odd fellow, I'll say"*, the Keeper says
	- [[Balthazar]] was a Keeper
		- The one before V
		- It was roughly a decade ago
		- He was originally a resident of Clover, but after his pupil passed, he decided to make a home for himself in Diamond
	- He isn't mentioned much nowadays, because it's "in bad taste to leave your kingdom after you are the fucking Keeper".
	- HE WAS A TAROT USER
	- The Keeper drops the idea that - if Cordelia were to apply for the position of Keeper - she would probably need to work her way up through the military and work on her powers
		- Her father and mother probably requested that she would (work her way through the military) actually
	- Keeper says that Cordelia can find [[Balthazar]] in [[Wigson]] (this is said VERY quietly)
		- [[Wigson]] IS CLOSE TO [[Iron forge]] 
	- The Keeper also says that Balthazar's an *ASSHOLE* and a *DICK*

## Preparing for Our Journey
- It's a bright, sunny day -- a little chilly (since it's getting closer to autumn!)
- Camille goes to the Quartermasters (everyone follows)
	- It's like a U-Haul
- Camille tells the person at the desk that we're sent from the Keeper to pick up some supplies
	- Gloves for all of us (+ an extra set of gloves so Cal can wear them over his other gloves, ad have them be fingerless)
	- A lead box
- Cal requests bolas
- The guy pulls out a box (upon realizing which party we are):
	- Bolas
	- Gloves for all of us
	- 4 scrolls
	- 2 books
- What else the party requests
	- Cal: small pouches of gunpowder
	- Kaya: clay
	- Camille: 1,000 ball bearings
	- Cordelia: a riddle???? (she ended up getting one)
- Camille thanks the guy for his help, takes the box, and leaves
- Cordelia is the last to leave, and she's asked how many rations we need
	- She asks Vallen for his opinion
	- 5-6 days worth, and with 5 of us it's 30 total

## Going to the Blacksmith
- THE DWARF LOOKS SIMILAR TO [[Durgen Coalbeard|DURGEN]]???
	- He seems to know Durgen, and reacted positively to hearing that we're friends with him
	- HE'S DURGEN'S COUSIN
	- DURGEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE RUNNING THIS SHOP? HE ALSO DIDN'T KNOW WHERE DURGEN WAS
- Camille requests a bow
	- They get it, plus a quiver full of arrows (+30 arrows)
- The dwarf gives Cal a piece of paper with *schematics* (for something??? CAL CAN'T READ LMAO)
- SIDE NOTE: Kaya can read (she wants to make sure Cordelia thinks she can't read tho)
- Camille requests a weapon that can be used by someone who isn't that strong (like them)
	- Camille receives 4 magic items, they can choose 1!! (Izzie needs to find them later)
- Camille also request a shield (small one, like a buckler)
	- GET BUCKLER (+1 to AC)
- THIS PLACE IS EMPTY
	- All the workers took their day off
	- His name is [[Vograr Gravelchin]]
- After leaving, Camille messages [[Durgen Coalbeard]] to let him know that we met his cousin, and that Vograr knows where he is
	- ‚ÄúHELLO CAMILLE!!!!!!! GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU! I DONT HAVE ANY COUSINS BUT IM GLAD TOU MET ANOTHER DWARF! COME SEE ME ANYTIME‚Äù
- CAL RETURNS TO THE BLACKSMITHS AND CONFRONTS VOGRAR??
	- *HE'S GONE???*
- CAMILLE IMMEDIATELY MESSAGES [[Ozwin]] AND LETS HIM KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
	- 3 minutes later, 5 guards burst through the doors (followed by Ozwin)
	- HE'S LIKE WHERE'S THE BLACKSMITH (we fill him in on what we know)
	- The blacksmith is dead in the back room :( same with the folks helping him
- Camille realizes they told someone dangerous where Durgen is
	- THEY MESSAGE DURGEN TO APOLOGIZE AND SAY TO STAY SAFE AND THAT THEY'LL BRING BACK SOUVENIRS
	- ‚ÄúHELLO CAMILLE!!! DO NOT WORRY I HAVE WEAPONS AND IM NOT WORRIES! I WILL HAVE THE GARRISON LADY GIVE ME GUARDS!‚Äù
	- Camille's beating themself up about this
- [[Ozwin]] posits that maybe the [[Changelings|changeling]] took on a familiar form so they could steal our information/mannerisms
	- [[Ozwin]] tells us that if we encounter a familiar face in an unfamiliar setting, we probably shouldn't tell them too much
	- *He also requests that we tell him if this happens*

# Traveling to [[Lycoris]]
- We agree to use to the door/key to go to [[Lycoris]], then camp in the area so we can leave first thing in the morning
- We hear a familiar voice as we arrive: *"Cordelia?"*
	- **IT'S [[Julian|JULIAN]]!!!**
