- We agree to go to [[Mossley]] (by using Foo’s Key to travel to [[Clover Capital|the Capital]], then to Mossley via the ferry)
- [[Camille Xotli|Camille]] goes to retrieve a commission from [[Durgen Coalbeard|Durgen]] while the party gets ready to leave
- Camille [[Foo's doors|uses the key on the bar door]], and the party teleports to the Garrison in the Capital

# Arriving in the Capital
- As we walk through, some people give us weird looks like “where’d these guys come from? why are they walking in from the back room?”
- Catching a ferry
    - We remember that we need to be on the north side of the Capital to catch a ferry
    - The next ferry leaves in 1-2 hours
- We run over to the bakery to grab a snack before we have to leave!
    - It’s midday right now, so it’s a little packed
    - [[Island]] says that [[Lawrence Elysian|Cordelia’s brother]] hasn’t stopped by yet for the day -- [[Cordelia Elysian|Cordelia]] declines waiting around to meet him, since we’re on a bit of a tight schedule
    - We end up getting a little picnic basket filled with our orders from last time + like 10 bear claws
        - The picnic basket is enchanted to contain more than what it’s normally able to, but the enchantment only lasts for a day
    - Law will NOT be informed of Cordelia’s presence

## Making Our Way to Port
- We ACTUALLY make our way to port now
- We notice a heightened military presence leading up to the port
    - A few guards are carrying boxes towards the port, while some are chatting
    - We can assume that these are people who are heading over to Mossley to fight the [[Warforged]]
- At the port, we see a MASSIVE ship!!!
    - About 3 stories in total (although we can assume it’ll be able to fit under the bridge between NorthPass and SouthPass
    - The ship is named **The Iron Wave** -- the name is written in strong lettering
- There’s a military person checking people docking the boat (like a fantasy TSA)
    - We all introduce ourselves -- the person recognizes our names and says that [[Ozwin]] informed them of our arrival
    - [[Cal Corvo|Cal]] announces himself with his full name LOUDLY. We all look around to see if anyone recognizes his name in a sus way
        - [[Kaya Avarice|Kaya]] notices that a civilian perks his head up, closes his book, and casually books it
        - Kaya does NOT say shit about this
    - The ship should leave in about an hour-ish
        - Apparently there’s something that needs to be taken care of before we leave?? But we get no info about it
    - **We should talk to [[Sentinel Vayla]]**

# Aboard the Ship
- There’s a large, gruff woman organizing people on deck
    - We approach -- she does NOT see us right away
    - She seems to be missing two fingers on her **left** hand (her pinkie and ring finger)
- We introduce ourselves as the people Ozwin sent
    - Our quarters are on the second floor (it’s the larger of the quarters, usually reserved for guests). We’re handed a key for it
    - [[Warden Holt]] will come get us when it’s time
    - We’re instructed to not get in the way
- We head to our quarters
    - It’s a similar setup to what we had in the Keeper’s Tower: separate rooms connected by a single common area (living room/kitchen). It’s set up like CJ’s apartment
    - We have a patio/balcony-esque thing that overlooks the ocean
- We get settled in and choose our rooms. As we do so, the ship starts to move
- Kaya and Camille have to make CON saves to not get seasick
    - They both pass‼️‼️‼️
- There’s a knock at the door. Kaya opens it
    - There’s a rather slim woman with long blonde hair in military attire (she looks TIRED)
    - She’s Warden Holt
    - She’s to fetch us so we can look at things??? She just tells us to follow her rather than explaining further
- Warden Holt takes up a flight of stairs
    - SHE’S TAKING US TO LOOK AT A MAP
    - She opens a door right next to what appears to be the captain’s quarters and ushers us in

## Examining the Map
- Tall burly man with short red hair (looks human and also older)
    - Cordelia looks closer 👁️👁️ and discerns that he still appears to be human
    - **This man is the captain (we don’t get his name)**
- Warden Holt has been working on the map
- [[Finnigan Seamus|the Captain]] was under the impression that Ozwin was going to be with us -- no he is not
    - The Captain comments on not being told a lot. Camille commiserates
    - With that, the Captain leaves
- Warden Holt was told that we have connections to the Warforged
    - Ozwin told her that we’re to be observing the battle - rather than engaging in combat - so she prepared a MASSIVE birds-eye view map of Mossley
    - Good guys and bad guys are color coded blue and red
    - She’s still deciphering the map
        - It’s encrypted, they got it from a mission in Diamond a while back. She’s still working on deciphering it
        - The encryption looks like a mix of Infernal and Dwarven
            - Cordelia takes a look at the encryption, but can’t crack it at a glance
            - Warden Holt knows most languages, but hasn’t gotten to crack the code yet (no solid evidence yet)
- Warden Holt informs us that there’s a bar on the lower level, but we’re warned that we’ll probably run into a lot of military personnel there
- Camille casts <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Enhance Ability</span> on Warden Holt before we leave to give her advantage on all INT checks for the next hour

## Futzing Around at the Bar
- Kaya tries to get some info about how long this trip is going to take and grabs some random guy
    - Rolls for STR and Intimidation
    - SHE SCARES THE SHIT OUTTA THIS POOR GUY
    - **IT’S A 2 AND A HALF DAY JOURNEY.** HE ALSO THINKS HE’S GETTING ROBBED 😭😭😭
        - It’s expected that we’ll arrive in Mossley in the afternoon, assuming that everything goes to plan
- We got to the bar :(
    - THERE ARE A FUCKTON OF PEOPLE HERE??? (probably people getting off the morning shift)
    - Everyone rolls to stick their dick in the pretty barmaid. brothers we MUST stay focused!!!
        - Everyone rolls high (LILY GETS A 19 AND A NAT 20)
            - **BCS IT’S HER BIRTHDAY, LILY GETS ADVANTAGE ON ALL “STICK HER DICK IN IT” ROLLS**
- [[Naomi|The barmaid]] comes up to us
    - Redhead, has her hair up in a military-grade bun
    - She leans over the table and EVERYONE (except Camille) is like 👀
    - VALLEN LOOKS AT THE LADY’S BOOBS!!!! HER EYES ARE UP THERE
    - Camille’s being respectful though. Her eyes are literally up there 🙄
- PPL START QUESTIONING CAMILLE ABT THEIR SEXUALITY AND AGE?? They literally go to get wine
    - These people… driving them to drink…… smh
- We all have to make Perception checks
    - WE SEE [[Julian|JULIAN]]!!!! I FUCKING CLOCKED IT. I LOVE IT WHEN MY THEORIES ARE RIGHT
        - We all notice that it’s him
        - CORDELIA NOTICES HIM AND DIVES UNDER THE TABLE
    - ON KAYA’S NAT 20 SHE ALSO NOTICES THAT VALLEN’S ALSO GONE!!?!??!?!?
        - OH MY GOD. KAYA SEES HIM SITTING NEXT TO JULIAN 💥‼️💥💥💥💀💀‼️👀
- Kaya rolls Insight vs Cordelia’s Deception to try and convince her to talk to Julian
    - Kaya directs Cordelia to look at Vallen and Julian at the bar
- Camille offers to eavesdrop on Vallen and Julian. Cordelia agrees and Camille walks away NOT STEALTHILY AT ALL!!!
    - Vallen invites Camille to sit next to him and Julian. When Camille asks Vallen who his friend is, WE FADE TO BLACK!!!!
- IN THE MEANTIME CAL GETS THE GIRLIEPOP TEA!!!!!!
    - Every time Cordelia answers a question, she and Cal and Kaya take a shot
    - He learns that Julian is who Cordelia is supposed to marry (as in an arranged marriage)
        - Cordelia was in her last semester of her degree at University when the marriage was arranged
            - - She came home to visit AND FOUND OUT ABOUT HER OWN WEDDING _THROUGH A WEDDING INVITATION!!?!??!??_
        - Cordelia’s mom (confirmed) arranged the marriage without Cordelia’s consent
- Cordelia is FEELIN it!!! Drunk as hell
- Cordelia looks over to where Vallen and Julian is. Camille is IN THE FRAY chatting with their arm around Vallen (Vallen’s arm is also around them) and they’re laughing and pointing at each other like saying “this fuckin guy”
- BACK TO THE QUESTIONS WITH CAL
    - Learns that the guy’s name is Julian (and that he’s Captain Devorak’s son)
    - Does she want to talk to Julian?
        - She met him at the party -- when she got the invitation to her own wedding she FREAKED OUT. He was really nice to her at the party so that threw off her whole perception of him (and the assumption that he’s an asshole)
- Cordelia feels like she’s about to throw up (but doesn’t!) the room is spinning for her a little bit
    - Kaya hands her a glass of water
    - The barmaid comes over -- Cal comments on her arrival and says “Oh tits magee is here!”
        - BRUH
    - The barmaid suggests that there’s a concoction on the boat that makes the spins go away
        - It’s completely clear and a little sparkly
        - Looks like sparkling water tbh (Cordelia doesn’t know what else is in it though)
    - Cordelia takes it. The room stops spinning, but she’s still drunk 😎
        - She casts <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Prestidigitation</span> and starts playing with some fun little sparkles and stars

### CORDELIA MEETS JULIAN FR!!!
- Vallen and Camille are telling Julian about our adventures in Holden -- specifically when we killed Dagen
    - IT’S REVEALED THAT VALLEN’S “BUDDY CAL” SET FIRE TO THE MANSION

    - Camille asks if he liked her. He did :)
    - Vallen ROLLS FOR SOMETHING?? He asks Julian if he knew her name

    - Cordelia comes to the conclusion (muttering to herself about it) that Vallen is probably trying to “tap that”
        - She GRIPS THE TABLE WITH TWO HANDS AND STANDS TF UP!!!!!!
- While everything is happening, Kaya’s at the bar (separated from Camille and the boys) sweet talking the barmaid 😳
- CORDELIA PULLS UP HER BRITCHES AND TELLS CAL THAT SHE’S GOING TO TALK TO VALLEN
    - While she pulls up, Camille is like “Vallen ur real nice to me… thank you” AND THEN SHE DRAGS VALLEN AWAY TO TALK TO HIM!!!
    - WHAT’S VALLEN DOING???
        - He’s trying to get to know Cordelia’s future husband (she’s MAD about it though -- she doesn’t think Vallen’s “ploy” is cute or funny or that he cares about anything that we do)
        - In response, Vallen says that he sees that she’s really mad, and says that he’ll retire for the night
        - Vallen tells Camille that he’s going to bed, they say that they’ll retire too (they don’t like drinking)
- Cordelia stops Camille from leaving, tells them to go sit with Cal
    - Cordelia goes up to Vallen and demands an explanation for why he’s messing with Julian when he hasn’t shown significant interest in her or the party before
    - He asks if she’d go over herself. Cordelia is SILENTTTTTT
        - Vallen says “You like him”
        - He started the conversation for HER!!!!! AND SHE’S MAD AT HIM FOR IT!!!!!! DAMN
        - In his 300 years of never doing the romantic side of “it”, he says that Cordelia should have her chances, rather than living to regret it
            - CORDELIA CAN TELL THAT HE’S GOT SOME PAST TRAUMA ABOUT ROMANCE!!!!!
            - Vallen: “Been through it before myself, and lived to tell the tale.”
- Cordelia asks Vallen if he was genuinely enjoying the conversation with Julian
    - He was!
    - CORDELIA DRAGS HIM BACK **(but instead of pushing him towards the bar where Julian is, she pushes him towards Cal)**
        - THERE ARE LIKE 3 GNOMES STANDING ON EACH OTHERS’ SHOULDERS AND HELPING CAL DO A KEG STAND
        - Camille brought Julian over to cheer Cal on
- Cordelia comes over, rotates Camille out of the way (they try to ask her what fake name she’s using, gets rotated instead)
    - JULIAN SAYS “hi there. you’re pretty, I’m Julian 😏”
        - AS SOON AS CAL HEARS THE NAME “JULIAN”, ONE OF HIS ARMS GIVES OUT
    - Cordelia grabs a random drink brought by the barmaid and SLAMS IT, without even looking at Julian (staring straight forward)
    - CORDELIA INTRODUCES HERSELF BY HER NAME!!!!!
        - 💥💥💥💥‼️💥💥‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
        - HE SAYS HE’S DRUNK WHEN SHE INTRODUCES HIMSELF!!!! CORDELIA SAYS IT’S OK BCS THEY’RE “ON EVEN FOOTING”
- Cal sees Julian, gives him a once-over, and tells Cordelia that he’ll kill him if she asks
    - Julian freaks a bit, Camille tries to introduce him (Cal), but Cordelia has them sit down (they’re present for the whole conversation)
- Cordelia says that they’re supposed to get married
    - He’s like “yeah”
    - C: A friend of mine said that it would be good to say something
    - J: Was it Vallen? He’s a good guy \*more muttering about Vallen\*
    - C: Yeah, Vallen’s a good guy… It’s just, look. You don’t know me, I don’t know you, we kinda just got like-
    - J: Wait (CJ ROLLS SOMETHING). You were at the party, too
    - C: (ROLLS DECEPTION. ROLLS BADLY) No…. (obviously lying)
    - J: You were! You were at the party. You were- we danced, didn’t we?
    - C: Yeah….
    - J: Well, it’s a pleasure to meet you, I guess. Look, we should have this conversation when we’re not both drunk. But we have two days ‘till Mossley. we’ll talk. Okay?
    - C: Okay.
    - J: Okay.
- As the conversation wraps up, Cal’s now wrestling with the Gnomes
    - JON’S WORDS: LIKE IN GULLIVER’S TRAVELS
- Julian walks away, stumbles, and trips and falls as he leaves
- Cordelia looks for Vallen (he’s at the bar, a little ways away from Kaya)
    - ALSO KAYA’S BARMAID IS INTO IT!!! HUZZAHHHHHHH
    - ![[YEAAAH.png|240]]
    - THE BARMAID TELLS KAYA THAT SHE HAS A ROOM NEARBY. KAYA GOES DOWN WITH HER. AND _ON_ HER 😈
        - CORINTHIA ROLLS A NAT 20 ON PERFORMANCE!!!!!!
            - Note from future Izzie: The barmaid DEFINITELY remembers her name. And so does everyone else on the floor apparently 😳
- We joke about Cal getting together with the gnomes
    - Something something 3 gnome hands = 1 dick
- Cordelia rolls up to Vallen at the bar and pops her elbows up there
    - Vallen tells her that he has really good hearing, and Cordelia can tell that he’s basically sober
    - C: Why are you helping with this?
        - LILY ROLLS INSIGHT TO SEE WHAT HIS MOTIVE IS. NAT 20!!!!!
    - V: I can see you’re trying to dig into this. I’m gonna tell you a secret. And we’ll keep it a secret for as long as we can.
    - C: \*Holds out her pinkie\*
    - V: As you can tell, I’m in my late 20s, early 30s, around that range. I had… a family. Before I was turned into a vampire. And… it did not go as it- according to plan. Um… aging 300 years and being an elf, y’know, half-elf, shorter lifespans. So, had a family, turned into a vampire, didn’t talk to them after that. Uh… Though I _was_ there for my son’s final words.
        - **HE HAD A SON!?!?!?!?**
    - V: And if I had not gone up to her at a bar, completely intoxicated, it never would have happened. Yeah, so that happened, we won’t go deep-diving into my past traumas on that one, but I am an advocate for whatever it is _you_ have.
    - C: It must’ve been awful…
    - V: It was terrible. The heritage continues, there’s a family with my last name out there somewhere.
    - C: Always
    - V: Yeah, so ever since then…
        - In the background, Cal’s trying to figure out how far he can throw a Gnome
        - Cordelia rolls for Insight to see if there’s anything between herself and Vallen. SHE CAN TELL THAT HE CARES FOR HER!!!
    - V: So… go for it.
    - C: \*nods\*
    - V: And with that, it is _almost_ time for bed, because we started at 2, and it is now \*looks at nonexistent watch\* 8, so we’ve been here for about 6 hours.
    - C: Goodnight, Vallen.
    - V: Goodnight
- As Vallen turns to leave, he looks to the side and asks “where did Kaya go? and where did the barmaid go?”
- Cordelia goes back to her bedroom -- alone
    - Kaya is NOT there
- Vallen calls out to Cal, asks him if he’s staying at the bar
    - He’s still with the gnomes, but instead of wrestling they’re sitting on the floor eating eggs 💀🥚
    - Cal’s eggs are _not_ fresh, but they’re not moldy 👀
    - Vallen bids goodnight to Cal and he leaves
- Vallen passes by Camille and pats them on the shoulder
    - Camille mentions that Cordelia basically left, and asks if she went back to the gang’s room (yes)
    - They ask if they made things worse (no)
    - They say that they’ll go “home” soon, and bid Vallen goodnight
- Camille locks eyes with Cal across the bar, holds up a glass towards him
    - He offers Camille a half-eaten egg, they reluctantly take it
- Camille and Cal stay until the bar closes
    - The bar closes at 10-ish (2 hours later), and they go to bed

# DAY 2: THE MURDER MYSTERY BEGINS
- As we’re waking up, there’s a knock at the door that gets progressively faster (Vallen is NOT here)
    - Camille fell asleep in the living room, so they go to get the door -- **it’s the captain**
    - He needs all of us. Right Now.
- Camille starts knocking on doors waking people up, Kaya rolls up behind the captain
    - Cordelia wakes up without Any hangover
    - The Captain rushes us as we get the gang together
- The Captain walks with us, very calmly but at a brisk pace
    - We get to the third floor - where the captain’s quarters are - and directs us to the navigator’s quarters where (where Warden Holt was)
    - He asks if we ate breakfast -- no. He says this is good.
- We all roll for Perception as the door opens
    - We see Warden Holt leaning over her desk, throat slit, blood everywhere.
    - On the wall behind her, we see the Diamond insignia, written in her blood. This symbol is ALL over the walls
    - There’s a knife that’s still stabbed into her back - up until the hilt itself - and the map she was working on is torn to shreds
    - **We don’t see the book she’s decoding**
- Questions
    - Does anyone else know? No
    - Who found her like this? The Captain
- The Captain says that we were invited on this trip to “observe” so he assumed that we’d be good at that kinda stuff
    - Camille shares that the book she was decoding is missing
- The Captain knows that we could distrust him, but we need to keep this _quiet_ for now. He will make an announcement later
- Cordelia: Investigation (looking into the scene in-depth) 19
    - The map is torn to shreds. It looks like someone grabbed it with their bare hands and ripped it apart (IZZIE NOTE: CAN CAST <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">MENDING</span> ON IT? TO TRACK DOWN MISSING PIECES, IF ANY)
    - The Diamond symbol is comprised of four diamonds, assembled in the shape of a diamond (kinda like how the Triforce forms a triangle, but for diamonds)
    - In big bold lettering - behind Warden Holt - on the wall: **DIAMOND WILL NOT FALL**
- Camille: Insight 23 -- on whether or not he’s telling the full truth
    - It doesn’t seem like he’s lying purposefully, but he isn’t telling us the full truth about where he was
    - He’s NOT lying about him being the murder
    - Camille ushers everyone into the room and closes the door behind them
    - Camille asks more questions: tell us everything you know, and where were you?
        - The captain was in his room last night. He has a guard that’s usually outside his door until about midnight, which is when he goes to bed. There’s a regular rotation of guards who would’ve seen him, but that also means that they should’ve seen the murderer
        - He says that he has a list of people he suspects -- people who he wasn’t able to investigate thoroughly before this mission
            - **[[Sentinel Vayla]] (she/her):** usually oversees the deckhands. Not that she’s suspicious, but she’d have more information
            - **[[Myra Delaine|Journeyman Myra Delaine]] (she/her):** in charge of the sending stones and messenger ravens
            - **[[Bram Trsk|Journeyman Bram Trsk]] (he/him):** the cook
            - **[[Sulk|Warden Voss]] (he/him):** the quartermaster. He’s usually checking the ship’s inventory late into the evening. He’s also the only one to know if something went missing from the ship’s inventory
- Cal: Investigation with ADVANTAGE (23) -- on the knife
    - Recalling Cal’s information from Diamond, the knife is _not_ a standard-issue knife. He’s _never_ seen the craftsmanship of this knife before.
        - The knife that’s used for Clover has an ornate handle, and has a straight edge
        - The knife that Diamond uses has a darker - black - handle, and is also straight-edged
        - **The knife here is slightly curved at the very end, and has a straight handle. It’s a very rudimentary knife that was made out of the bone of something**
- Cal: Investigation on the wall (13)
    - When drawing the symbol of the Diamond kingdom, it usually goes from top to bottom (top diamond, right and left, then bottom). However, this symbol goes **_counterclockwise_**. This _could_ mean that the person who drew them was in a hurry
- The Captain needs to assess the rest of the crew, so he needs to leave
    - He will release a statement around noon
    - Kaya asks him to return a timeline or something, but he needs to do damage control first
    - He asks where Vallen is. Camille says he’s probably taking a walk, and asks Cordelia to send him a message using the fancy sending stone
        - He doesn’t respond immediately
- Cordelia asks Camille if they noticed anything in the book, since they were the last person to speak to Warden Holt
- Camille starts casting <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Mending</span> on the map. It’s torn to shreds, so any pieces that are missing would be immediately obvious (and if there are no pieces missing, then we’ll be able to learn what Warden Holt learned)
- Cordelia + Kaya: History (16) -- to remember any of the signs, symbols, or messages that she could see on the book that was stolen/the map
    - Additional Perception (14): There’s something on the ground -- a small object shaped like that the hole that one would use for an allen wrench. **It’s a decoder**
    - **She sees 3 words on the decoder: “DIAMOND”, “ DOESN’T”, “WANT”**
- Cal: Investigates the body further (11)
    - Looks like Warden Holt was initially slit in the throat
    - The dagger was subsequently stabbed into her back
    - Blood splatters?
- Party Investigation
    - ONLY Kaya passes (NAT 20!!!). She sees no signs of struggle. There’s no forced entry. **This means that Warden Holt knew and trusted her assailant to some degree**.
    - Camille theorizes that Warden Holt learned something after they cast <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Enhance Ability</span> on her, and she invited someone to her quarters to tell them about her finding. When her assailant found out, they probably killed her to keep her mouth shut.
    - Cordelia theorizes that whoever killed her is higher-up in the military
- Vallen enters
    - He theorizes that the person who entered cast <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Invisibility</span>, and entered during a period of time when Warden Holt left and re-entered the room
- Cordelia casts <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Detect Magic</span>
    - Also rolls Perception (16)
    - She sees some residual magic. **Magical footprints** seem to have walked around the room a little before leaving through the door. When Cordelia opens the door to follow the footprints, they’re gone.
- **CONCLUSIONS SO FAR:**
    - Looking for a spellcaster (there are HUNDREDS of people on the boat, and many of whom are spellcasters)
- Camille finishes casting <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Mending</span> on the map
    - Half of the map is missing. Anything containing information on the enemy sigils are ripped away
    - Cordelia concludes that everything about the enemy locations are more or less correct
    - We remember the rough placements of enemy soldiers, but nothing super accurate
- Camille:
    - Realizes that <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Mending</span> has a limited range, and offers to carry around the map and cast <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Mending</span> on it every so often, assuming that the assailant didn’t immediately throw away the missing pieces
    - Tells the party that they can cast <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Speak with Dead</span>, assuming that the body still has its head coming tomorrow morning
        - They can cast <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Tiny Hut</span> as a ritual spell to ensure that nobody enters the room
        - Vallen also offers to guard the body
- Kaya starts grilling Vallen on where he was
    - He was in the kitchen, eating raw meat -- he didn’t encounter the chef though, since he was trying to be sneaky
    - Vallen starts grilling Kaya in turn, and she affirms that she spent a “lovely night” with the barmaid (whose name she still never got)
        - Something something magic strap (requested by Lily)
- Cal says that - as someone from Diamond - the way the symbol drawn is extremely strange
    - As children, they’re taught to draw the symbol from top to bottom, not in a circle
    - Vallen agrees
    - Camille theorizes that someone’s trying to frame Diamond
        - Cordelia theorizes that someone in the Clover military is trying to frame Diamond for some reason
- Cal and Camille roll straight d20s
    - Camille thinks that it’s either a **Clover sympathizer** or someone in the **[[Clover military]]**
- Vallen’s seen the knife somewhere before, Camille casts <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Enhance Ability</span> to give him advantage on Intelligence checks
    - It’s most likely a custom knife -- You can’t be a Journeyman and afford that kind of knife
    - Someone on the ship definitely had the knife, Vallen recognizes it
