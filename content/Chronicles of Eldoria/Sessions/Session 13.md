# Investigation Recap
- The Room
    - The Diamond Kingdom’s symbol is drawn on the walls in [[Warden Holt|Warden Holt’s]] blood
        - The symbol is drawn incorrectly (clockwise instead of top to bottom) -- not in the way that a true Diamond citizen would draw it
    - There are no signs of struggle or forced entry
    - There are traces of magic (magical footprints) that circle around and lead out of the room
        - Illusion magic
- The Body
    - Warden Holt was sitting at her desk when she died, no signs of struggle
    - Warden Holt’s throat was slit, and then she was stabbed in the back
    - We did not check for belongings or investigate the body further
- The Knife
    - Unlike any standard-issue knives made in Diamond _or_ Clover
    - Slightly curved at the very end, and has a straight handle. Very rudimentary but also _custom-made_ knife made of bone
- The Map
    - The map was torn into pieces. Although ==Mending== was cast on it, at least half the map is missing
    - The parts that are missing contain the red sigils which indicate exact enemy locations and information
    - [[Camille Xotli|Camille]] will walk around the boat and cast ==Mending== on the parts of the map that we _do_ have to see if we can locate the missing pieces (and see who has them/where they are)
- The Encrypted Book
    - Written in a cipher that is a combination of both Dwarvish and Infernal
    - Obtained during an infiltration mission in Diamond
    - Contains unknown information
    - Stolen (assumedly by the assailant)
- The Decoder
    - Found on the floor of the navigator’s/Warden Holt’s room
    - Showed 3 decrypted words of the cipher when acquired: **“DIAMOND”, “ DOESN’T”, “WANT”**
- List of suspicious people (or people that could be in the know), provided by [[Finnigan Seamus|the Captain]]
    - **[[Sentinel Vayla]] (she/her):** usually oversees the deckhands. Not that she’s suspicious, but she’d likely have more information
    - **[[Myra Delaine|Journeyman Myra Delaine]] (she/her):** in charge of the sending stones and messenger ravens
    - **[[Bram Trsk|Journeyman Bram Trsk]] (he/him):** the cook
    - **[[Sulk|Warden Voss]] (he/him):** the quartermaster. He’s usually checking the ship’s inventory late into the evening. He’s also the only one to know if something went missing from the ship’s inventory
- **CONCLUSIONS**
    - **The assailant is:**
        - A spellcaster of some kind, since they were able to get behind Warden Holt without arousing suspicion
        - Either a Clover sympathizer or Clover military personnel
        - Likely rich and relatively high-up in the military (i.e. NOT a Journeyman), since they could afford a _custom_ bone knife
    - **Further theories:**
        - Warden Holt was assaulted by either an invisible spellcaster who slipped in when she left the room OR she tried to share her findings with a traitor disguised as someone she trusted.
        - The assailant _could_ be connected with the suspicious citizen who reacted strangely to hearing Cal’s name at the docks.
    - **Current plan of action:**
        - Limit the number of people who can view the body (==Tiny Hut== was ritual cast by Camille, and Vallen will guard the body to be extra safe)
        - Speak with the people from the list provided by the Captain
        - Limit movement around the ship and lock down peoples’ locations (quarantine them?) after the Captain announces the murder
        - If necessary, use ==Speak with Dead== to talk to the body and get more information (after the next long rest)

# Session Begins
- We discuss who to speak to first
    - [[Kaya Avarice|Kaya]] theorizes that the knife could’ve been _gifted_ to a Journeyman, but also acknowledges that it’s not super likely
- It’s currently 8 AM, we have 4 hours until the Captain announces the murder
- We decide to invite the list of people the Captain gave us to breakfast (+ the Captain himself) and interrogate them there
    - The Captain agrees to our plan, and is off to order the list of people to join us at breakfast -- it should only take 10-ish minutes
    - Camille asks for a list of the guards on shift last night (list acquired!)
    - We will be dining in our quarters (guest rooms) 😎
    - The Captain grabs some papers from his desk, shuffles them into his bag, and then heads off with us
- The Captain uses Sending Stones to text some people
- As we arrive at our room, the Captain makes himself comfortable on our couch, and we agree that the cook (Bram Trsk) will bring us breakfast
    - Camille asks the Captain what his name is: **Finnigan Seamus**
- 10 minutes after we arrive, people start filing in
    - First: [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]]
    - Second: Sentinel Vayla (sits near the Captain)
        - The Captain helps us lie about why these people are invited -- he says that he’s recognized their hard work and wanted to reward them
    - Third: Journeyman Bram Trsk (Dwarf)
        - He brought breakfast!!
        - Cal helps him carry everything in and makes small talk
    - Fourth: Warden Voss (Tiefling; tall and lanky)
    - Fifth: Journeyman Myra Delaine (Half-Elf; tall and blonde; handsome)
- The Captain introduces us to the group
    - Journeyman Trsk asks how long this is going to take. Camille says no more than half an hour
    - [[Cordelia Elysian|Cordelia]] pretends to have stomach issues, and asks Camille to “help [her] in the bathroom”
        - Before she leaves, she puts the decoder down on a small table
- **THE PARTY SPLITS UP!!!**
    - Cordelia and Camille go to investigate the rooms of the people on the suspect list while they’re away
    - [[Kaya Avarice|Kaya]] and [[Cal Corvo|Cal]] stay behind to ask after alibis and look for potential motives

## Kaya and Cal: Breakfast
- Jokes are slung about Kaya’s night with [[Naomi|the barmaid]]
- **Bram Trsk**
    - Cal asks when the kitchen closes: technically never, but the cook usually heads home at around 2-3 AM. BUT, **last night, he left early (around 11 PM)**
    - **HE LOST A KNIFE RECENTLY?? IT’S MADE OF BONE**
        - It’s a personal belonging. If it was stolen, then it was taken from his personal belongings
        - Part of the reason he left early was to look around his room to look for the knife in his room
        - Kaya Insight (17): he’s not lying about the knife
- Kaya makes a “joke” asking what people were doing last night: getting drunk, committing murder…. 👀
    - Captain Seamus gets up, locks the door, and tells everyone that they’re ACTUALLY there to be interrogated, because a murder was committed last night
- **Warden Vayla**
    - Last night she was checking the rigging on the ship -- usually takes a few hours
    - She usually goes out by herself, so nobody can back her up
    - She ALSO believes that her 12 years of service on this ship should help prove her loyalty
- **Journeyman Myra Delaine**
    - Last night she was sending messages to the Capital, keeping them updated
    - She decoded a message from the Merchant’s Guild to ensure that the Warforged don’t know we’re on our way
    - Insight checks
        - Cal (3): believes that she’s telling the truth! (loves women 👫)
        - Kaya (23): believes that she’s telling the truth! (loves women👭)
- **Warden Voss**
    - Was checking the lockers (keeping up on inventory)
    - The inventory log is in the quartermaster’s quarters -- he can’t get it right now
    - Insight Checks
        - Cal (17) & Kaya (15): He’s telling the truth!
- Cal tries to accuse of Warden Vayla of lying, claiming that we know where she was last night
    - She fails her Insight check against him, and tries to defend herself saying she was just trying to do her job and didn’t actually kill anybody
    - Insight Checks
        - Cal (16) & Kaya (18): She’s telling the truth

## Cordelia and Camille: Snooping Around
- Where rooms are situated
    - Murder rooms are upstairs
    - Our quarters are on the middle floor
    - All other quarters are downstairs

### Journeyman Delaine’s Room (Communications Quarters)
- There are papers scattered over the desk with some Sending Stones
- Camille casts ==Mending==. Nothing changes on the map
- Camille suggests that Cordelia cast ==Detect Magic== before we leave the bottom floor to check for any traces of suspicious magic
- Cordelia investigates the papers on the desk (Investigation 16)
    - She sees decoded messages from the Merchant’s Guild
    - Nothing of a ton of note
    - **Both the Dwarvish and the Infernal alphabets are laid out**
- Cordelia casts ==Detect Magic== to look for traces of Illusion magic
    - She sees some traces of magic - as if Journeyman Delaine has cast magic before - but there’s nothing that stands out
    - **HOWEVER she sees magic that is not classified as a school of magic**
- There’s also nothing in the desk drawers

### Journeyman Trsk (Chef’s Quarters)
- Right next to the mess hall
- He has a personal kitchen for himself, the bed isn’t super made, and all the furniture is a little lower to the ground since he’s a Dwarf
- Cordelia doesn’t see anything with ==Detect Magic==
    - Perception (3), but her PP is 15
    - **She sees the same footprints. They go from the door to his closet, then back out the door**
- Cordelia looks in the closet
    - It’s filled with personal bags
    - Camille tries to look around, but rolls a Nat 1 on Investigation :(
    - Cordelia pokes around, and finds some traveling clothes and a small box of knives -- **there’s an empty indent whose shape matches the knife in Warden Holt’s back. All the knives look custom-made**
- Cordelia looks under the mattress
    - Investigation (NAT 20!): She sees that he has a few weapons (standard Dwarven weapons)
- Camille casts ==Mending==. Nothing happens
- We try to follow the footprints.
    - **They go down the hallway and lead to the stairs which go to the bottommost level of the ship**
    - **They look like they originated from a side broom closet, and ended there as well**
- Cordelia realizes that **_the magic looks more potent when the footsteps start, and it looks less potent when they return_**

### Warden Vayla’s Room
- Basic-ass room. Spartan as hell
- Camille casts ==Mending==
    - A FEW SCRAPS FLY BACK TO THE MAP!!! We now have the parts with Mossley, but we’re still missing the parts with the mountains
    - The pieces came from under the rug that she has
- Cordelia doesn’t sense any notable traces of (Illusion) magic in this room
- Cordelia and Camille discuss the possibility that Warden Vayla is being framed, since it’s odd that the scraps of the map were tucked away in such an easy-to-locate place (and only a small portion of the map at that)

### Warden Voss’s Room (Quartermaster’s Quarters)
- There are some folks out and about, moving crates and stuff -- obviously Voss’s subordinates
- Voss’s room is also located at the bottommost level of the ship
- Camille casts ==Mending==. Nothing happens.
- Cordelia looks around with ==Detect Magic==
    - There are very faint traces of Illusion magic around the room (unable to tell if it’s THE illusion magic or just other Illusion spells)
- Camille’s passive perception (15) reveals:
    - THE WINDOW IS OPEN???
    - The latch seems intact -- like it was opened purposefully
- Cordelia takes a closer look at Voss’s desk
    - IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE’S BEEN PRACTICING HOW TO DRAW THE DIAMOND EMBLEM
- Cordelia sends a message to Kaya via Sending Stone
    - Message asks Kaya to get everyone’s handwriting (specifically to write “Diamond”)

## Kaya and Cal: Back to Breakfast
- Kaya inquires as to which of the group are spellcasters
    - Journeyman Delaine, Journeyman Trsk, and Warden Voss
    - Specialities?
        - Journeyman Delaine: Transmutation (for sending stones)
        - Journeyman Trsk: Transmutation (for cooking)
        - Warden Voss: Illusion and Transmutation (he was originally a Sorcerer)
- Kaya passes out pens and papers and asks our suspects to draw the Diamond insignia + write some stuff down
    - While this is happening, Kaya and Cal look real close at our suspects to check for whether or not anyone is particularly nervous
        - Delaine and Voss are both right-handed, Trsk and Vayla are left-handed
        - The younger ones are a little more nervous, but that could be chalked up to inexperience
    - Everyone draws it wrong: **Trsk, Delaine, and Voss draw it counter-clockwise**, Vayla draws it clockwise
        - Remember: the symbols drawn in the navigator’s room were drawn counter-clockwise
    - They also acquire everyone’s handwriting!

## Cordelia and Camille: Back to Investigating
- We go back to the navigator’s room
- Vallen’s there! We catch him up a little (he now knows about the extra map pieces and where we found them)
- Cordelia checks Warden Holt’s pockets
    - 2-3 GP in her left pocket
    - Her right pocket is turned inside-out -- as if something was inside and taken out
- Cordelia checks the wounds
    - NAT 20 INVESTIGATION
    - **Whoever did it is left-handed**
- Camille checks for open windows
    - THEY’RE OPEN!???!
    - Vallen opened them 😭😭😭
- CAMILLE CONNECTS THE DOTS!!!
    - They theorize that the killer COULD be a Changeling
    - Vallen notes that Changelings use Fey magic
    - Vallen ALSO theorizes that Changelings use Illusionary magic, and that magic occurs _instantaneously_ -- so the footsteps being stronger in the closet is likely because a Changeling used magic to change
        - There’s a moment where Vallen says “Changelings can change their form -” and Camille responds with “I don’t 😐”
    - Camille says that there’s a spell called ==Detect Evil and Good== that helps detect Fey
        - Vallen doesn’t have it :(

## Reuniting!
- Camille and Cordelia head back to our quarters, leaving Vallen behind
    - The gang goes to a different room and shares their findings!
- Cal says that he could threaten people, but Camille counters and says they can just cast ==Zone of Truth==
- Cordelia analyzes the sheets of paper with the Infernal and Dwarvish alphabets
    - It looks most similar to Voss and Delaine’s handwriting
- We theorize that **Voss** is trying to frame Vayla
    - Camille also says that Voss’s window was open, so he probably threw out the remaining pieces of the map
- Camille tells our suspects that they’re casting ==Zone of Truth==
    - Everyone is willing to submit, and they all (probably willingly) fail their saves
    - The party chooses to fail their saves as well
- Cal fails the ==Zone of Truth==, but twists his words and says that we found pieces of the map under her rug 👀
    - **CORDELIA SEES VOSS AND DELAINE EXCHANGE A GLANCE!!!!!!**
        - Cordelia whispers this information over to Cal
    - Vayla says that she didn’t kill anybody
- Cal says that Trsk’s knife was missing, and his knife was missing
    - Trsk says that he didn’t do it -- Insight check reveals that he’s telling the truth
- CJ asks us to roll for Arcana and Perception
    - Everyone rolls higher than a 10 on Arcana except for Camille
    - Camille and someone else (forgor) rolls higher than a 19 on Perception
- Camille asks Voss what he was doing last night and where he was
    - Rolls Perception (dirty 20) and History (19)
    - **CAMILLE REMEMBERS: the weapons crates were being freshly unloaded near Voss’s room while we passed by**
    - They ask why he was checking the crates when they were just unloaded -- he was also only unloading them for 10 minutes
        - EVERYONE NOTICES HIM USE A SUBTLE SPELL!!!
        - EVERYONE BUT CAMILLE REALIZES THAT IT WAS A ==MODIFY MEMORY== SPELL_
    - After he checked the crates, he went to Delaine’s room
        - Camille questions him more: they fucked. Camille does not care.
        - While they were hanging out, they worked on some decoding something using the Infernal and Dwarvish alphabets
- Cordelia presses Delaine for more details
    - They were trying to learn the alphabets to help in the morning
    - Delaine says that she doesn’t have the book, and neither does Voss
- Camille just straight-up asks if they know where the book is.
    - SILENCE!! BOOKED AND CLOCKED AND BOOKED!!!!!!
    - They say that they can ask an easier question: “Are either of you changelings?”
        - MORE SILENCE!!! GOT THEIR FUCKING ASSES

## COMBAT BEGINS

        - JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW

# Post-Combat
- Camille casts ==Spare the Dying== on Voss, and asks for help tying him up before they heal him
    - Kaya helps to tie him up
- Camille talks to the Captain and says that thye’d like to heal him up -- the Captain says they can heal and question him once he’s thrown in the brig
    - They agree to this and try to pick Voss up (Strength 3) and they CANNOT
    - The Captain helps out

- Cal enters the bubble, grabs the knife, and leaves, whistling to himself and flipping it as he walks 😊🎶
    - KAYA’S STILL FOLLOWING HIM LMAO
- Cordelia and Vallen debrief. Vallen now knows:
    - That it was Voss and Delaine, and they were Changelings

        - Cordelia follows
