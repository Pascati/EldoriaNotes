# Recap
- We took a long rest!
- While we were resting, [[Cordelia Elysian|Cordelia]] had a very weird dream -- she's never had a dream like that before
- We will be given a letter by the townsfolk to deliver to [[Clover Capital|the Capital]]
- We rescued those kids!!

## Preamble
- There are multiple schools in the capital!
	- In order to gain the title of "Mage", one needs to complete their schooling through one of the schools
- I missed a lot of stuff :( Izzie had wine and typing is hard

# Morning Comes
- We all wake up in the morning in our separate rooms!
	- Everyone benefits from a Long Rest (i.e. no Exhaustion levels!)
- STORY INITIATIVE
	- [[Cordelia Elysian|Cordelia]]: 16
	- [[Camille Xotli|Camille]]: 9
	- [[Kaya Avarice|Kaya]]: 3

## Cordelia Wakes Up
- Cordelia wakes up in a cold sweat
	- What she saw in her dreams left her shaken -- she knows that something about her - or something about her future - has changed
	- She goes downstairs to greet the day!
- Her body got rest, but her mind didn't really get rest
- [[Foo|Foo (the bartender)]] is sweeping the floor, says breakfast will be done in 30 minutes

## Camille Wakes Up
- Puts on their little vest (carries the cloak on their arm)
	- DM note: it's early summer!
	- Camille carries their cloak on their arm to account for the weather

## Kaya Wakes Up
- Hears the pitter patter of feet outside her room
- Smells PANCAKES??? oh it's joever
- Heads downstairs, takes her sweet time and enjoys the luxury suite

## Breakfast
- Kaya and Camille meet Cordelia downstairs in the morning
- THE SETTING/ROOM VIBE:
	- Mostly just the party (3 of us) + the bartender, Foo
	- A few stragglers from the night before, not really in the mood for talking
		- Both stragglers are human -- they didn't pay for a room, so they're not getting food
- Cordelia is steeling herself for the days to come
- Cordelia hears the pitter patter of little feet below her! There's probably a downstairs to this bar
	- We actually all hear this
- Perception
	- Cordelia: nat 20
	- Kaya: 19
	- Camille: nat 20
- Kaya assumes that the footsteps she hears are *children's footsteps*
- Cordelia and Camille can hear the *footsteps of the children we saved!!*
- Breakfast is being prepared!
	- A firbolg with blue skin and reddish hair - a lady wearing an apron - kindly greets us and hands us our plates
	- She bows and heads back to the kitchen <3

## Meeting the Elders
- Cordelia mentions that her walk from the Capital was about a day and a half
- Camille comments on how they hope the kids we rescued are doing well (the footsteps pause, there's giggling, and they keep on going)
- Cordelia asks the gang if we had any weird dreams the night before
	- Both answer no
	- Camille insights that (21 insight vs 4 deception)
		- Homie knows she's lying
		- Camille encourages Cordelia to share her dreams
- Before we can continue talking, there's a knock on the tavern door
	- It's one of the village elders!
	- Because they're so eager, they wrote the note we're meant to to deliver already
	- There's a carriage already prepared for us, and **we'll be awarded upon arriving in [[Clover Capital|the Capital]]**
		- With the carriage, it might take us 2-3 hours to arrive in [[Clover Capital|the Capital]]!
		- Gold is in the carriage, *the guards will give us our gift upon receiving the gold and the note that was handed to Camille*
- Cordelia and Camille try to reject the gift of gold
	- Kaya's chill w/ it though
- The elder requests that we *deliver the note to the command garrison in the inner city*
	- Upon delivering the note, we'll receive our reward and we can wash our hands of the whole business
	- The note requests additional aid and guards for the town, since the townsfolk cannot afford to hire their own as-is
- The elder bows and leaves, leaving the door open behind him (as if inviting us to leave as soon as we can)

## Preparing to Leave
- Camille asks Kaya to check on the carriage
	- Camille asks Cordelia if she's ok, she LIES like a lying liar and says she's ok
	- INSIGHT VS DECEPTION. Camille won 😎
- Kaya notices two guards alongside our carriage!!
	- Both are at the front (so neither are at the back)
	- One has a spear, and they're dressed in yellow
	- A guard asks if it's just Kaya, and she says "these fuckers are eating their breakfast"
		- The guard responds that they have a schedule to keep, and Kaya says that she'll DRAG our asses out if she has to
- Cordelia confesses that she has some anxiety returning to the capital
	- She'd rather get this portion of her trip over with - and either prove or disprove her point - and she would rather not say anything else on that front
	- Camille respects that, SHOVELS their food in their mouth (so much of it falls on the floor 💀 rip)
	- Kaya returns to fetch us!!

# On the Road!
- Some townsfolk come to see us off I think
- As we leave, Cordelia starts fidgeting with her cards again
- It's DEAD FUCKING SILENT for the first hour
	- It's literally the guys in the bus staring at the wall and the sun ![[460.png|360]]
- It starts RAININGGG
- One of the guards taps on the window with their spear -- *we're almost an hour out from [[Clover Capital|the Capital]]!*
	- Neither Kaya or Camille have been to [[Clover Capital|the Capital]] before!
	- Cordelia's ass does NOT sound enthusiastic about returning
	- Kaya asks about what [[Clover Capital|the Capital]] is like!
		- Cordelia describes the seasons, the sights and sounds, and the waterways
- Cordelia tries to divert the convo away from herself by asking the gang about how she ended up in [[Hillford]]
	- Kaya was there for a job! She completed it, and now she's excited to get paid
	- Camille was just Wanderin

# Arriving in the Capital
- What we see
	- There are HUGE walls (attack on titan style)
	- Lines of people trying to enter AND leave [[Clover Capital|the Capital]]
- A guard with a three-leaf clover insignia on his chest
	- On Camille's side! They crank the window down
	- Asks what we're here for, Camille is honest and shows him the letter upon request
- We're allowed into the city!!
- There are shops and shacks along the road, houses on top of houses! It looks like they're running out of room here on the outskirts of the city
	- **CORDELIA'S ASS IS LITERALLY SHRINKING IN SHAME!!** she does recognize some nice restaurants and shops tho 🤩
- We're in the carriage for another *30-ish minutes before we pass another wall*
	- History check for the gang!

			- Their whimsical ass is just along for the ride
	- Arcana check for the gang!
		- Cordelia (advantage): 22

			- Cordelia says that her dad mentioned it was to take care of the day markets so their merchandise doesn't get wet
- There's a knock on CORDELIA'S side of the carriage (Kaya has to roll the window down LMAO) and we've *arrived at the garrison!*

	- Camille hops out and sees some shops! There's a pastry shop directly across from the garrison (has a symbol of a three-leaf clover)

	- She turns down the offer for ==Calm Emotions==, and exits the carriage, covering her face with the cloak
	- Kaya pokes fun of Cordelia a little 🤭 (Cordelia's ass does NOT engage)
- Kaya asks if she can look at the letter before we go in
	- Camille hands her the letter
	- She sees everything that we've been told -- what we did, that the chest is full of gifts for us. It's also addressed to the captain of the guard (Purah)
		- The seal's already been broken, bcs the guard at the gate already looked at it 📧

## The Garrison
- There are two guards at the door, wearing *white robes* with armor over them
	- Elves, dwarves and humans are all over the place! *Everyone's wearing an insignia with the 3 clovers:* blue on the left, red in the middle, and green on the right (signifying the three elements!!)
- We see a desk with a [[Simon|smaller dude at it (most likely a halfling)]]
	- Asks to see the letter when we tell him who we're here to see

- Perception (for listening in on the convos)
	- Kaya: 23
	- Cordelia: 14
	- Camille: 15
	- We all see a 6-foot-ish half-elf (dude) (looks determined but also a little confused) wearing a *black robe* instead of a white robe, and his *armor has gold plating*. The insignia on his chest also has a *tree instead of a clover*
		- He turns to Kaya, and asks if we're waiting to see the owners of the [[Mithril]] camp

## THE INTERVIEW
- [[The Keeper|V]] dips his ink pen and takes notes on the following conversation
- **What our are intentions with the information we've found?**
	- Kaya: I am currently... trying to not get found by anybody in the capital, so when little miss captain started blackmailing us, I'm actually going to $comply$
		- ADDITIONAL ANSWER: I'm incredibly curious. At this point, I have to see it through.
	- Camille: I would be lying if I wasn't curious. I might go back to look around, but of course I'd report back if I find anything. And I'll do what I'm told.
	- Cordelia (been nervously shuffling her cards this entire time): I intend to learn, nothing more, nothing less.
- **Are you in this for just the money, or to better the world?**
	- Kaya: Well quite frankly, money is important. Quite truthfully, the only thing that could satisfy me is a good drink, a good bed, and a good time. I'm satisfied how I am.
	- Cordelia: I'm just hoping to find the next part of my half.
	- Camille: I mean, I want to help people, but I won't be mad if more people know my name.
- [[The Keeper|V]] sets the book down
- **Would you lay your life on the line for the sake of saving someone?**
	- Kaya: Well of course. It's quite literally my JOB to do so. ("$jobs\; aside,$ $would\; you?$"). Of course I don't WANT to die, but if it came down to it I would.
	- Cordelia: Yes.
	- Camille: I probably would.
- [[The Keeper|V]] says we passed! And that we deserve to know more information
	- He asks if his current form is good
	- Cordelia says *she's met a changeling once before*, and **in response [[The Keeper|V]] says that he's [[The Keeper]]**
- [[The Keeper|V]] mentions that he knows that we've been having visions: Cordelia once before and both Camille and Kaya last night.
	- ***HE ADMITS TO HAVING [[Dreams & Visions|VISIONS]] TOO!!!***
	- He thinks we're worthy enough: **[[The Keeper|V's]] the only other person to have visions**
		- *He has them VERY often*
	- Also admits that he told [[Captain Purah|Purah]] to give us a job in [[Hillford]]
- A list of [[The Keeper|V's]] disguises:
	- The town elder
	- The guardsman at the gate
	- [[Simon]] (thanks Camille for the danish 🥰)
- Cordelia is !?!?!? and says that all this is "outlandish"
	- He says that he needed to make sure that we're having the visions, otherwise he wouldn't want to speak to us
- [[Nicholas Powers|Nick Powers]] won't be joining us
- Camille asks [[The Keeper|V]] how he changes his appearance -- [[The Keeper|V]] responds that the best way to explain would be to see it
	- [[The Keeper|V]] asks Camille to cast a spell, to which they cast ==Guidance==
	- [[The Keeper|V]] casts ==Guidance== back, but 10x as good. His ability is that he can **copy any form of magic and use it at its max capacity**
	- He found this ability when he was a recruit
	- He doesn't want to BE in this position, and he doesn't want us to see him as a Keeper
	- He can also use some degree of temporal magic
- Camille offers for [[The Keeper|V]] to hang out with us???
	- He says he'll "hang out" with us once we get to know each other better
- [[The Keeper|V]] reaches into his pocket and pulls out *3 sending stones*
	- These stones are good for **one message and one message only**
	- Once a message is sent on the stone, it will reach [[The Keeper|V]] and will be teleported away
- Kaya's Question: If [[The Keeper|V]] has any temporal clues that might help us with our case
	- The Mage's Guild and [[The Keeper|V]] have discussed that a village will soon be in distress, and that we will need to go talk to them
- Cordelia's Question: "By our rank, I need to show you respect. It's been instilled in me since the day I was born. But I TRULY question why you're out here"
	- He asks if Cordelia isn't curious
	- He honestly just wants out of [[Clover Capital|the Capital]] LMAO
	- He's also very curious -- **Cordelia is the first wizard to have seen the visions**
		- *She's also one of the ONLY [[Tarot Cards|Tarot]] users*
		- Cordelia's always been drawn to the cards, so she's never been very curious about them
	- [[The Keeper|V's]] Story:
		- When he was a recruit, he was learning exactly what his copy magic skills entailed.
		- He felt burnt the fuck out, and tried to do more research
		- He asks Cordelia if she's ever wondered why some things are left out of the history books
		- Now that he's in a position of power, he can figure all these mysteries out without the extra barriers in the way
		- With the three of us being the only other ones to see the visions, **our job is to protect [[The Keeper|V]]**
		- He also wants to be more proactive to protect his people as a Keeper
		- What kept him going past the burnout was the curiosity of what lies BEYOND the books (roundabout way of answering Cordelia's question of why he's out here)
- Something something [[The Keeper|V]] talks about how he's super busy in [[Clover Capital|the Capital]] with all his meetings and shit
	- Camille comments on how someone who can disguise himself at will should be able to just skip out on meetings pretty easily
	- [[The Keeper|V]] says that there's no fun to be had in pretending to be someone else 💀
- Kaya vows to not let this fail
	- [[The Keeper|V]] encourages us to learn as much as we can and share our findings with him -- in return, he'll share what he knows with us
- [[The Keeper|V]] needs to attend to a mithril mine near [[Clover Capital|the Capital]] (it was attacked recently?) (we need to keep our lips ZIPPED about it)
- **[[The Keeper|V]] directs us to speak to [[Foo]]**, and to say:
	- **We met with his long-lost cousin** and that **it is time to travel**
- *If we need [[The Keeper|V]], we can use the sending stones*
- [[The Keeper|V's]] ass SUMMONS A BLACK HOLE (or what looks like one) and uses it to teleport away
