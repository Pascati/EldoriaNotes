	- [[Dagen]] is searching for the technology to allow him to walk in the day
- **[[Dagen|Dagen]]’S HOSTING A FANCY PARTY IN 6 DAYS!!!!**
	- We’d be tasked with **going undercover** and *posing as ambassadors from Clover*
	- We would need to find out [[Dagen]]’s plan
	- We’re basically the only ones they can send, bcs everyone else in the force is known by [[Dagen]]

# Long Rest Time 🥰
- [[Foo]] isn’t at the counter 🤨
- Cordelia asks if we’re leaving the business with the basement alone

- [[Foo]] emerges IN HIS PJS!!
	- he's so eepy
- Cal says that we should go find the basement
	- Cal rolls for Perception (NAT 20!!!)
	- He sees Foo’s eyes widen slightly at the mention of the basement

## THE GANG IS SNOOPING

- Cordelia casts <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Detect Magic</span>
	- Faint traces of magic leading from the top of the ladder to the bottom
	- TRANSMUTATION MAGIC
- As we climb deeper, the wood of the walls gradually turn into stone
	- CORDELIA FARTS AS SHE CLIMBS
- We see faint flashes of blue light coming from further down -- it’s very dark down here, uncharacteristically so
	- Cordelia senses that there is a magical darkness surrounding us
	- Cordelia realizes that nobody heard her fart, as if the sound of her fart was suppressed

	- Deception: 11
	- [[Foo]] sees through his lie, and asks what he’s really doing down here
	- [[Foo]] says he doesn’t really have anything to hide -- this is just his basement. He’s working on a request from [[The Keeper]], although now’s not the right time to talk about it
	- [[The Keeper]] says it was time for us to travel, so [[Foo]]’s working on a way for us to travel!**
- Cal signals for Cordelia to make a sound, and she throws a rock into the room
	- As [[Foo]] looks towards the sound, Cal tries to put some of the diagrams into his ring
	- [[Foo]] grabs his hand with LIGHTNING quick speed
- [[Foo]] says that he can’t tell us specifically what he’s working on, since [[The Keeper]] wanted it to be a surprise/secret -- BUT he’ll give us some information in exchange for us leaving

### Saying Goodbye to [[Durgen Coalbeard|Durgen]]

- Cordelia asks the gang if we’ve been to [[Lancaster]] before!
	- Cal hasn’t
	- Kaya hasn’t
	- Camille has
	- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] has (he burps when he says so)
- Camille has proficiency in land vehicles! So they’re the one driving (since we don’t have an armed escort this time)
- Cordelia asks us if any of us have been to a party of this caliber
	- Literally NOBODY has (except for maybe [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]]) 💀 chat we’re cooked
	- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] clarifies that he’s been to this type of party before, but he *wasn’t invited*
- **LITERALLY NONE OF US KNOW HOW TO TALK TO A POLITICAL FIGURE**
	- **CHAT WE’RE SO COOKED**
	- The trip takes ~3 days, so we’ll have that amount of time to study
- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] asks Cal why he doesn’t just “fuck off and leave”
	- Chat is wondering why they haven’t fucked yet. Lily says “type shit”
	- Cal responds that the job isn’t over yet -- and in response to further prodding he says “we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it”
- After a few hours of sparse conversation, Camille spots a town -- although they see the wall of it first
	- CORDELIA TRIES TO MOG [[Vallen The Immortal|VALLEN]]???????
	- ANYWAYS WE’RE AT [[Lancaster|LANCASTER]]!!

# Arriving at [[Lancaster]]
- The town is partially an military outpost
- Cordelia says that she hasn’t been to [[Lancaster]] since winter
- All we know is that the tailor’s is at the center of town
- There are some guards at the gates!
	- THE GUARDS ASK US FOR IDENTIFICATION TO ENTER THE TOWN
		- Worth noting that **Camille didn’t have to do this last time they were here**
		- Cordelia pulls out her student ID LMAO
	- Camille mentions to the gang that they didn’t have to identify themself last time they were here
	- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] says that it’s been 50 years since the last time he was here -- they have walls now!
- The gang discusses staying in town or not
	- Kaya argues that the quicker we get there, the faster we can plan and scout out, so camping out would be a good idea (we got supplies for this specific purpose!!)
	- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] can keep watch
- The gang looks around to look for the shop we need
	- CAMILLE GOT A NAT 20 sorry guys I’m not keeping track of the other rolls
	- Anything lower than a 15 can’t rlly place what’s what
	- Camille immediately spots the tailor’s shop LMAO
- The streets are oddly empty for 3 PM
	- Camille asks some passers-by why the streets are so empty and why there are guards at the gates
	- The recent vampire attacks 💀 yeah that tracks

## Arriving at the Tailor’s!
- This tailor’s shop is PRISTINE!! Smooth jazz plays in the background
- Cordelia rolls to try and remember this place (15 History)
	- She remembers this shop being very nice the last time she was there, but while she doesn’t remember the shopkeep specifically, she remembers getting a very nice dress
- We ring the bell at the counter
- [[Varrell DeFontaine|VARRELL'S]] HERE???
	- He has a dimensional door attached to the shop (he does NOT let Camille see 🙁)
	- “My back door is very private” - [[Varrell DeFontaine|Varrell]]
	- This shop doesn’t get a lot of traffic, so [[Dox|“Cory”]] used to run between shops and keep this one staffed
- We get an extra tent from [[Varrell DeFontaine|Varrell]]!
- We also get a flare (in case we need help or people need to find our bodies) as we leave the town

# On The Road Again
- Camille asks Cordelia to tell us what to expect
	- Do not reveal to much of yourself when talking to people (they’ll talk shit!)
	- Only drink with your left hand
	- Don’t let your drink get empty
- We make our way to the edge of the ~~forbidden forest~~ [[Forest of Mysteries]]!!
	- On the way there, we can se the beginnings of the ocean
- Camille suggests that we make camp a little ways from the entrance of the woods

## Making Camp
- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] is making us dinner!
	- He knows how to cook pretty well!! Although since regular food doesn’t do a lot for him, most of his cooking is done for mortals
	- Camille offers to help :]
- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] asks what our dreams our about, out of pure curiosity
	- Cal reveals he hasn’t had any dreams (except for one after meeting the gang)
	- Camille comments that the dreams aren’t as bad as the nightmares they’ve had before since they technically don’t die during them
	- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] asks what triggered the dreams and how long we’ve been having them
		- Camille is hesitant to answer, since we weren’t given clarification on whether or not we can or should share the content of the dreams or the [[Orb]]
		- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] says that he’s [[The Keeper|the Keeper's]] right hand man, so anything [[The Keeper]] knows, he’s allowed to know
- Cordelia decides to message [[The Keeper|V]] via sending stone (an extra one is provided by [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]]) to ask whether or not he’s the actual right hand man
	- **“hello this is Delia. just checking, is the man we are traveling with your right hand man? his name is [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]].”**
	- The stone glows bright blue, and then the glow fades (the arcane runes disappear) -- she needs to press a new rune on the stone to hear the response:
		- **“Hi again. Yes I know [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]]. Yes he’s my right-hand man. I sent him to help. Why do you ask?”**
	- Camille sends a follow-up response with another sending stone from [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] (thank u bestie):
		- **“Hello! This is Camille. We're asking because we're not sure what we can share, but [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen's]] been very helpful. Can we talk about the dreams?”**
	- In response, they hear:
		- **“Oh yeah no, he knows everything about the Orb. And the dreams. I talk to him about my dreams.”**
- Camille confirms that we got dreams from the [[Orb]], and [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] asks why *Cal’s* been having dreams since he hasn’t been in the proximity with the [[Orb]]
	- Camille tries to explain what the [[Orb]] is like (Cordelia’s like ?!?!?!)
- Cal describes his dream (blood raining down, bodies everywhere, a man floating in the sky)
	- Cordelia rolls a Wisdom save (NAT 20): she recalls that as being her first dream -- the one that *only SHE* had
- The party explains our most recent dream ([[Pyramid|black pyramid in the sky]], red runes, red light crashing into the ground)
	- Upon hearing this, Cal walks away
	- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] chases after him and asks what his deal is -- Cal’s seen this [[Pyramid]] before. He’s come across it in his previous travels decades ago, and it was left behind by some government officials
	- Cal doesn’t think that this information will help right now
	- Cal says that [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] should tell the group since we know him better ([[Vallen The Immortal|VALLEN]] DOESN’T AGREE)
- Cal has to roll a DEX save (16)
	- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] teleports them back to the campfire AND CAL THROWS THE FUCK UP
- Cal shares that he saw the pyramid 20 years ago in a city he didn’t keep track of
	- The gang thanks him for sharing!!
- Camille theorizes that using the [[Orb]] with the keyhole will likely trigger the [[Pyramid]]
	- ***OOC NOTE: [[The Keeper|The Keeper]] HAS THE [[Orb|Orb]].***
- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] says that they don’t want to try to open the door rn because what if it lets something out?
	- So now the agents of [[The Keeper]] are trying to find out as much as possible and plan accordingly
	- Also it’s been theorized that the door opens to an ancient city
- The gang muses on whether or not the [[Vampires|vampires]] and the [[Changelings]] are after the same thing (the [[Orb]]) and whether or not they’re working against or with each other

### Long Rest Time!!
- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] says that he can take care of anything while he keeps watch, but if something does happen, he will wake up Kaya first

### The Dreams
- We wake up in the swamp (except all four of us are there this time -- Cal has joined us!)
- The dream continues to play out like it did last time
	- A white mark seems to slash through reality itself, and as the tear rips open it encompasses us, we find ourselves standing in a field of grass with clouds and flowers, with a broken-down chapel in the distance
- We can talk to each other!!
- Camille picks a flower -- it’s pinkish blueish, and as soon as they do, the flower regrows
- More of what we see:
	- There’s a worn grass path that leads to the chapel. Past the chapel is a 20 ft sheer cliff and a river
	- In the sky is a [[Orb|GIGANTIC ORB (white and smooth)]]. Curvy light blue/white lines (as opposed to the jagged red lines of the [[Pyramid]]) cover its surface
- Camille books it towards the chapel ruins
	- We’re ALL sprinting towards the chapel
- There’s a very bright white light that shoots out of the chapel and hovers in front of the door
	- As Cordelia reaches out to touch it, it backs up, and begins to take the form of a [[The Curator|gentleman]]
		- Early 20s, brown cloak
		- LARGE brown wizard hat (very stereotypical)
		- Thin
- Camille asks if he’s real or a part of the dream
	- Not really part of either -- **not a part of our reality**
- Cordelia asks what his name is
	- He goes by many names, but he typically goes by **[[The Curator]]**
- Kaya asks what he curates
	- The [[Orb]] and the [[Pyramid|Pyramid’s]] dreams
	- He hasn’t had influence over the dreams recently, which is why he visited us to relieve us of our bad dreams
	- He wants to show us that not all dreams can or will be bad!!
- [[The Curator]] says that **the [[Orb]] prepares us for the future**
	- **The [[Pyramid]] acts of its own volition**
	- He's the balance between the [[Orb]] and the [[Pyramid]]
- **The [[Pyramid]] has been tampered with recently**
- **The [[Orb]] doesn’t have ill intentions though!!** It's just trying to prepare us for what might happen
- Camille asks if [[The Curator]] knows about [[The Keeper]]
	- He does, but [[The Keeper]] doesn’t know about *him*
	- **The [[Orb]] has chosen [[The Keeper]] to study it, but NOT know the future**
	- The [[Orb]] has chosen us to prevent what the [[Pyramid]] is planning
- [[The Curator]] refers to the [[Pyramid]] and [[Orb]] as the [[Shapes of Paracausality]]
	- Called this because they don’t abide by our laws of nature
- Camille asks if there are other realities and other laws of nature beyond ours
	- Yes, but we shouldn’t have to concern ourselves with those
- [[The Curator]] doesn’t have forever to talk to us, but *he will come to meet with us again in the future*
- A mirror the size of a door (the character creator mirror from BG3 but bigger) appears
	- We gotta leave before the [[Pyramid]] tries to take over the dream again!!

## We Awaken
- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen’s]] SHOCKED as we appear in our PJs in front of the campfire
	- We share what we learned about [[The Curator]] with him
- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] says he will pass on word to [[The Keeper]]
	- He also wonders what kinda dreams [[The Keeper|the Keeper's]] been having (THAT’S WHAT I’VE BEEN ASKING!!!)
- [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] reports that he only saw some deer and squirrels
	- Cordelia asks Vallen if he ate the deer and squirrels (he did. tried to lie abt it though LMAO)
	- Camille offers to help set up traps to catch them easier next time :]
- We sit down for breakfast! Camille helps to prep it with [[Vallen The Immortal|Vallen]] again
- **OOC NOTE: BEACH EPISODE CONFIRMED**
