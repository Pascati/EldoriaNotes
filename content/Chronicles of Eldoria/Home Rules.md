# Rolling Dice
- **Inspiration:** Spend one stack of inspiration to <u>add 1d8 to a roll</u>
	- If a player brings food or drink to share with the party, then - at the DMâ€™s discretion - they may be granted a point of inspiration
	- Each player can have up to 3 stacks of inspiration
	- A single roll can only benefit from one use of inspiration
	- Are there ways to get inspiration *OTHER* than bringing food:
		- When someone *does something really cool*, EVERYONE who sees it gets a point of inspiration
		- When someone *gives an inspirational speech* - and if the DM thinks the speech is good enough - the speech-giver and everyone who hears the speech gets a point of inspiration
- **Critical Hits:** Upon rolling a critical hit, one can choose to either double the number of damage dice they roll OR double the number they roll.
- **Guidance:** In order for <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Guidance</span> to apply to an ability check or attack roll, the person casting <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Guidance</span> must be informed of the roll beforehand and say that theyâ€™re casting the spell BEFORE the roll is made, not in the moment while itâ€™s being made or after.
	- Assumedly this also applies to any other spells or abilities that take an <u>action</u> or longer to cast/activate
- **Death Saving Throws:** The DM rolls each playerâ€™s saving throws in secret, so even the players themselves donâ€™t know the state of their character as they die (ooooh mystery ðŸ‘€).

# (Magic) Items
- **Healing Potions:** Drinking a potion takes a <u>bonus action</u>.
	- It takes a <u>full action</u> to administer a potion to someone else
- **Retrieving/Equipping Items:** It takes a <u>bonus action</u> to retrieve items from a Bag of Holding and equip them.
- **Sending Stones:** Unless otherwise specified (as with the case with the prototype sending phone), all sending stones are ONE USE ONLY.
	- One must already be in possession of a sending stone to receive messages from another sending stone
	- Rather than a verbal message, all messages sent via sending stone appear as text to the receiver
	- Messages are limited to 25 words in length (similar to the <span style="color:rgb(197, 124, 22)">Sending</span> spell)
	- **Prototype Sending Phone:** Has unlimited uses, and messages can be up to 50 words in length.

# Misc. Rules
- **Canon Gassiness:** Players (and DMs) who fart and/or burp during session must roll Charisma (Performance) check to determine whether or not the fart/burp is canon
- **Gold Stars:** Players that do something really smart or make the DM laugh get a gold star ðŸŒŸ
- **Interrupting the DM:** If a player interrupts the DM (and if the DM feels like it), the player in question takes 1d4 Psychic damage
