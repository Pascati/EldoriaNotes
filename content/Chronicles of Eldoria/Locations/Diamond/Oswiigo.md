- A town that people mostly pass through, since it's more or less just a trading post
	- Very open, only two roads going into/leaving town
	- There are lots of shops open, but when first encountered by the party merchants don't appear to be paying much attention
- A PLACE WHERE 300 GP DIAMONDS CAN BE BOUGHT FOR 100-ISH GP!!!
