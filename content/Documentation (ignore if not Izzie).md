## Theme Notes
- **THEME USED:** anuppuccin
- **THEME COLOR SCHEME:** [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)
- ***NOTE:*** I ended up downloading it manually ðŸ’€ but I'm keeping the fancy instructions JUST IN CASE (for instructions on manual install, go to the link above and CTRL+F search for "Manual install")


1. Go to the following folder and open *deploy.yml* in Notepad (run as administrator):
>	C:\Windows\System32\quartz\\.github\workflows

2. Add the following before the *permissions* section:
>	env:
>		 THEME_NAME: \<THEME-NAME\>

3. Add the following text in the *build* step:
>	- name: Fetch Quartz Theme
>	   run: curl -s -S https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saberzero1/quartz-themes/master/action.sh | bash -s -- $THEME_NAME

**NOTE:** changed *action.sh* to *action.bat*, since it was recommended that Windows users make the switch

*deploy.yml* should look like this:
```
name: Deploy Quartz site to GitHub Pages

  push:
