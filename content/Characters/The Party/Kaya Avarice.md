## History
- Adopted (assumedly from an orphanage?) by [[Kaya's Dad]] and her mother
	- According to Kaya, they adopted a kid to show that they're “put together” and “capable of caring for a kid”
	- *Kaya's first memory* is when she was *brought to her adopted parents' house* -- she remembers ***nothing*** from before she was adopted
- Following an unknown event, Kaya defected from/left her parents' faction (the [[Water Faction]]), resulting in her becoming a faction traitor
	- Kaya mentioned that she has some friends in the [[Earth Faction]], but whether or not she actually *joined* the [[Earth Faction]] following her defection is another story
- Fled the [[Clover Capital|Capital]] at some point, and spent some time living in the woods
	- During this time, she met a [[Mysterious Mercenary (Kaya Lore)|mysterious mercenary]], who taught her how to fight + everything she knows, and was the reason why she enlisted to become a mercenary (told her to do so)
		- According to Kaya, the [[Mysterious Mercenary (Kaya Lore)|mercenary]] was "on a job" and just so happened to camp near where Kaya was staying (in the woods)
		- As of the start of the campaign, Kaya doesn't know where this man is
