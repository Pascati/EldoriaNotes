- Initiated by [[Burt Maclyn]] in [[Session 1]] in an attempt to summon the [[Orb|"key orb"]] which would open the mysterious door in [[Hillford|the woods]]
- According to [[Nicholas Powers]], required the sacrifice of *10 bodies*, which needed to be killed/sacrificed at the same time

# The Door
- The ritual is set in a stone area with murals on the walls
	- Cordelia recognized a specific portion of it:
		- Small hole/alcove in the wall, with channels like wires running along the sides
	- The murals depict the War from nearly 800 years ago
		- The [[Spade Kingdom]] is turbo destroyed, with craters and shit
		- Depicts the mountains being raised
		- Between the mountains, there is an orb (the aforementioned divot in the wall)
			- Cordelia rolls and concludes that this [[Orb|orb]] could be a *key of sorts*, but has no idea as to what it's a key for or why the hole is there specifically
