- Vampire lore/functionality:
	- Most can't walk in sunlight
		- The only exceptions so far are *daywalkers* and vampires who use *shadow boxes* (little devices which cloak the user's body in complete shadow)
	- Must drink blood to survive
		- *Daywalkers* cannot drink humanoid blood, otherwise they lose their ability to walk in the sun. All other vampires are able to drink humanoid blood.

# Known Sub-Factions
- [[Dagen Coven]] (largely extinct due to the Party's actions)
