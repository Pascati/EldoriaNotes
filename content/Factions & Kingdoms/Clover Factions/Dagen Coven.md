#Sub-Faction

	- Note: daywalker vampires generally don't drink humanoid blood
- Led by the main vampire, [[Dagen]]
- Attacked [[Hillford]] due to the suspicion that someone's basement there would have the technology to allow regular vampires to walk in the sun (and thus still be able to drink humanoid blood)
- Largely wiped out after the death of [[Dagen]] at the hands of the party
